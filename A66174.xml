            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE nature of the Holy</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is a ſubject that hath been both ſo frequently inſiſted upon, and ſo fully explain'd in our own and other Languages, that it may well be thought a very needleſs undertaking for any one to trouble the World with any farther</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections <hi>upon it. For not to mention now thoſe Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Men who have heretofore labour'd in this work, nor to run beyond the points that are here deſigned to be examined; What can be ſaid more evidently to ſhew the impoſſibility of the pretended</hi> ſubſtantial change <hi>of the</hi> Bread <hi>and</hi> Wine <hi>into the</hi> Body <hi>and</hi> Blood <hi>of Chriſt in this Holy Sacrament, than has been done in the late excellent</hi> Diſcourſe againſt Tranſubſtantiation? <hi>It is but a very little time ſince the Adoration of the Hoſt has been ſhewn not only to be a novel invention, contrary to the practice of all Antiquity, but the danger of it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrated, notwithſtanding whatever pretences can be made of a</hi> good intention <hi>to excuſe them from the charge and danger of Idolatry, who continue the practice of it. And both theſe not only ſtill remain unanſwer'd; but if we may be allow'd to judge either
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:60616:3"/>by their own ſtrength, or by our Adverſaries ſilence, are truly and indeed unanſwerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not therefore out of any the leaſt Opinion that any thing more need be ſaid to confirm our cauſe, much leſs that I eſteem my ſelf able to undertake it with the ſame ſucceſs that thoſe other Champions of our Faith have done it, that I venture theſe</hi> Diſcourſes <hi>to a publick view. But ſince our</hi> Adverſaries <hi>ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, without taking notice of any of theſe things, to cry up their Great</hi> Diana <hi>no leſs than if ſhe had never at all been ſhewn to be but an</hi> Idol, <hi>I thought it might not be amiſs to revive our Inſtances againſt it: And that we ought not to appear leſs ſollicitous by a frequent repetition of our Reaſons, to keep men in the</hi> Truth, <hi>than others are by a continual inſiſting upon their ſo often baffled</hi> Sophiſtry, <hi>to lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Error.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Twas an ingenious Apology that</hi> Seneca <hi>once made, for his often repeating the ſame things;</hi> 
               <q>That he did but inculcate over and over the ſame Counſels, to thoſe that over and over committed the ſame faults:</q> 
               <hi>And I remember an antient</hi> Father <hi>has left it as his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that it was uſeful for the ſame truths to be vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by many,</hi> 
               <q>becauſe that one Man's Writings might poſſibly chance to come where the others did not; and what was leſs fully or clearly explain'd by one, might be ſupplied and enlarged by the other.</q> 
               <hi>And a greater than either of theſe, S.</hi> Paul, <hi>has at once left us both an example and a warrant for this ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude; Phil.</hi> 3.1. <q>To write the ſame things to you, to me <hi>(ſays he)</hi> is not grievous, but for you it is ſafe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Indeed I think if there be any need of an excuſe for this undertaking, it ought to be rather to</hi> Apologize <hi>for a
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:60616:3"/>far greater abſurdity which we all commit in writing at all againſt thoſe Men, who in theſe Diſputes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Holy Sacrament, have moſt evidently ſhewn that to be true of Chriſtians, which was once ſaid of the antient Philoſophers,</hi> That there can be nothing ſo abſurd which ſome Men will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to maintain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In moſt of our other Controverſies with thoſe of the</hi> Church of Rome, <hi>we ſhew them to be</hi> Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; <hi>in this they are</hi> Extravagant; <hi>And as an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Pen has very juſtly expreſs'd it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diſcourſe againſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, Pag. 2.</note> 
               <q>The buſineſs of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is not a Controverſie of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> againſt <hi>Scripture,</hi> or of <hi>Reaſon</hi> againſt <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> but of downright <hi>Impudence</hi> againſt the plain meaning of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and all the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> of mankind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The truth is, as the ſame Perſon goes on,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <q>It is a moſt ſelf-evident falſhood: and there is no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Propoſition in the World that is of it ſelf more evidently true, than Tranſubſtantiation is evidently falſe.</q> 
               <hi>And if ſuch things as theſe muſt be diſputed, and this Evidence,</hi> 
               <q>That what we ſee and handle, and taſte to be Bread is Bread, and not the Body of a Man; and what we ſee and taſte to be Wine is Wine, and not Blood, may not paſs for ſufficient without any farther Proof, I cannot diſcern why any Man that hath but confidence enough to do ſo, may not deny any thing to be what all the World ſees it is, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it to be what all the World ſees it is not, and this without all poſſibility of being further confuted.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:60616:4"/>
            <p>
               <hi>But yet ſince it has pleaſed God ſo far to give over ſome Men to a ſpirit of deluſion, as not only ſeriouſly to believe this themſelves, but alſo raſhly to damn all thoſe that cannot believe it with them, we ought as well for the ſecurity of thoſe who have not yet abandoned their</hi> own ſenſe <hi>and</hi> reaſon, <hi>in compliance only with others who in this matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to have laid aſide</hi> theirs; <hi>as in charity to ſuch deluded Perſons as are unhappily led away with theſe Errors, to ſhew them their unreaſonableneſs: To convince them that Chriſtianity is a</hi> wiſe <hi>and</hi> rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Religion: <hi>that 'tis a miſtaken Piety to ſuppoſe that Men ought to believe</hi> Contradictions; <hi>or that their</hi> Faith <hi>is ever the more perfect, becauſe the Object of it is impoſſible: That our</hi> Senſes <hi>ought to be truſted in judging aright of their proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; that to deny this is to overthrow the greateſt external Evidence we have for our Religion, which is founded upon their judgment; or if that will be more conſiderable, is to take away all the grounds that even themſelves can pretend to, wherefore they ſhould disbelieve them in favour of</hi> Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this I perſwade my ſelf I have in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe ſufficiently ſhewn, and I ſhall not need to repeat it again here. For the</hi> words <hi>themſelves, which are the grounds of this great Error, I have taken that</hi> Method <hi>which ſeemed to me the moſt proper to find out the true meaning of them; and, as far as the nature of the Enquiry would permit, have endeavour'd to render it plain and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble even to the meaneſt Capacity. And I have ſome cauſe to hope that the moſt learned will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with the deſign, what ever they may be with
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:60616:4"/>the performance; it being from ſuch that I have taken the greateſt part of my</hi> Reflections, <hi>and in which I pretend to little of my own beſides the care of putting together here, what I had obſerved ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down in parts elſewhere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was ſo much the more fit at this time to inſiſt upon this manner of arguing, in that a late diſturber of the Fathers, the better to ſhew the Antiquity of his new Religion, has pretended to ſearch no leſs than into the ſecrets of the Jewiſh</hi> Cabala <hi>after it, and to have found out</hi> Tranſubſtantiation <hi>there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt of the</hi> Rabbinical Follies:

               </note> 
               <hi>Now however the very name of</hi> Galatinus <hi>be ſufficient to Learned Men to make them eſteem his Judgment in his</hi> Jewiſh <hi>to be much the ſame as in his</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Antiquity <hi>which follows after, in thoſe eminent pieces of S.</hi> Peter<hi>'s and S.</hi> Matthew<hi>'s</hi> Liturgies,

            <p>
               <hi>But whatever thoſe of the</hi> other Communion <hi>ſhall pleaſe to judge of my Arguments, yet at leaſt the Opinions of thoſe eminent Men of their own</hi> Church <hi>may certainly deſerve to be conſider'd by them, who have freely declared that there is not in Scripture any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof of</hi> Tranſubſtantiation; <hi>nay ſome of whom have thought ſo little engagement upon them either from that or any other Authority to believe it,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:60616:5"/>that they have lived and died in their Church without ever embracing of it.</hi>

They who ſhall pleaſe to peruſe his Book, will find enough in it to ſpeak in his Advantage; and if they have but any tolerable diſpoſition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the truth, will clearly ſee, that this point of</hi> Tranſubſtantiation <hi>was the production of a blind and barbarous Age; unknown in the Church for above one thouſand Years, and never own'd by the greateſt Men in any Ages ſince. The truth is, if we enquire preciſely into this buſineſs of</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>we ſhall find the firſt foundation of it laid in a Cloyſter by an unwary Monk about the beginning of the 7th</hi> Century:

               <hi>It is I ſuppoſe ſufficiently evident from what has been before obſerved, how little aſſurance their own Authors had, for all the</hi> definition <hi>of the</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Lateran, <hi>of this Doctrine.

Monſieur Bigot: <hi>who diſcourſing with Father</hi> Raynauld <hi>at</hi> Lyons <hi>about this matter, the</hi> Jeſuit <hi>confeſs'd to him that it was true, that he had himſelf a copy of his</hi> Treatiſe <hi>which he would communicate to him, and that it was Father</hi> Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond <hi>whom upon this account he reflected upon in his Book,</hi>

               <hi>My next inſtance will be more undeniable, and it is of the ingenious</hi> Monſieur de Marolles <hi>Abbot of</hi> Ville-loyn, <hi>well known in</hi> France <hi>for his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Writings and great Abilities.

                  <p>I Cannot but exceedingly wonder that a certain Preacher, who reads the Holy Scriptures, and will maintain nothing but by their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſhould nevertheleſs undertake to defend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Oppoſers by the Scriptures, the Real Preſence in the Euchariſt out of the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving; and think himſelf ſo ſure to overcome in this Occaſion, as to talk of it as a thing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and in which he knows he cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted.</p>
                  <p>It would certainly be more ſafe not to be too much prepoſſeſſed with any thing. I will not name the Perſon, becauſe I have no mind to diſpleaſe him; But in the mean time, neither Senſe, nor Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor the Word of God have ſuggeſted to him one word of it; unleſs the Apoſtle was miſtaken when he ſaid, '<hi>If ye are riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things that are above, where Chriſt is ſate at the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above and not on things upon the Earth.</hi> Coloſſ. 3.1, 2. For how could he ſpeak after this manner, if Jeſus Chriſt be ſtill upon Earth by his real Preſence under the ſpecies in the Euchariſt?</p>
                  <p>When he aſcended into Heaven, he ſaid not to his Diſciples which ſaw his wonderful Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:60616:11"/>
                     <hi>I ſhall be with you always by my</hi> Real Preſence <hi>under the ſpecies of the Euchariſt, which ſhall be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly expoſed to you.</hi> In his Sermon at the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which he had juſt now celebrated, and which immediately preceded his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt according to S. <hi>John</hi> ſays expreſly to his Apoſtles, that he was about to leave them, that he ſhould not be long abſent, that he would ſend to them the <hi>Comforter;</hi> but not one word of his <hi>Real Preſence in the Euchariſt,</hi> which he had ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtituted under the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> to be a Myſtery of our Faith for the nouriſhment of the <hi>Soul</hi> to <hi>life Eternal,</hi> as ordinary <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are for the nouriſhment of the <hi>Body</hi> to a <hi>temporal Life,</hi> and that too for ALL the faithful, as is clearly ſignified by thoſe Words, <hi>Drink ye all of this.</hi> Whereupon I have elſewhere remark'd the cuſtom of <hi>Libations</hi> which were in uſe time out of mind throughout the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and which cuſtom was eſtabliſh'd in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the gods: As may be ſeen in the Verſion of <hi>Athenaeus</hi> in 1680; and as I had obſerved long before upon <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> though there was but little notice taken of it. Which makes me think it very probable, that our Saviour intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſanctifie this Profane cuſtom, as he did ſome others, which I have remarked in the ſame place.</p>
                  <p>When Men undertake to prove too much, they very often prove nothing at all: To maintain that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is intire in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> with all his Bodily extenſion, and all his Dignity, ſo as he is in Heaven; ſo that under the <hi>Roundneſs</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> there is nothing that is <hi>Round;</hi>
                     <pb n="xx" facs="tcp:60616:12"/>under the <hi>Whiteneſs</hi> there is nothing <hi>White;</hi> this is what the Scripture has not ſaid one word of. They are indeed meer <hi>Viſions,</hi> and which are not ſo eaſie to maintain as Men may think. The Prieſt who celebrates breaks the <hi>Hoſt</hi> in three pieces; One of theſe he puts into the Cup, of the two others he communicates, in memory as 'tis plain of what we read, That <hi>Jeſus the night in which he was betray'd took Bread, and when he had given thanks he brake it, and ſaid, Take, Eat, This is my Body which is broken for you, Do this in Remembrance of Me.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23, 24. In the <hi>Maſs</hi> there is here no more <hi>Bread,</hi> they are only the <hi>appearances of Bread,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,</hi> and which are not tied to any <hi>Subſtance.</hi> And yet ſo long as there is but one <hi>Atom</hi> of thoſe <hi>Accidents</hi> which they call <hi>Euchariſtical ſpecies</hi> in the <hi>Conſecration</hi> that has been made, the <hi>true Fleſh</hi> of the Lord Jeſus is ſo annex'd to them, that it remains there whole and intire, without the leaſt confuſion, and may be ſo in diverſe places at the ſame time. I doubt not but thoſe who teach us this Doctrine have thought of it more than once; but have they well conſider'd it? for there is not one word of it in all the <hi>Sacred Writings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it nothing that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſaid to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles but a little while before his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> when he was now about to celebrate his Holy Supper with them, <hi>You ſhall have the Poor always with you, but me ye ſhall not have always, Matth.</hi> 26.11.

                  <p>They ſay to the People, Behold your Creator that made Heaven and Earth: And the People ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſecrated Bread in the <hi>Ciboire</hi> wherein 'tis carry'd abroad, ſays, Behold the <hi>good God</hi> going in proceſſion to confound the <hi>Hereticks:</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their natural inclination, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore with all their Hearts they know not what, becauſe ſo they have been inſtructed; and the better to maintain their prejudice intire in this matter, they become mad: But alas! they know not what they do, and we ought to pity their Exceſs.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, who can tell whether the Prieſt has <hi>conſecrated,</hi> or indeed whether he be capable of <hi>conſecrating?</hi> Is it a point of Faith to believe, that among ſo many Prieſts, not one of them is a <hi>Cheat</hi> and an <hi>Impoſtor?</hi> This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly cannot be of Faith; and if this be not, neither is that which expoſed with ſo much Pomp, to carry the true Body of the Lord through the Streets, of Faith. Thus the belief is at beſt but <hi>Conjecture;</hi> and then whatſoever in ſuch caſes is not of Faith is ſin, according to the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23.</p>
                  <p>I know not what colour can be ſufficient to excuſe ſo ſtrong an Objection, unleſs Men will abſolutely reſiſt the Holy Scripture, and right Reaſon founded upon it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis further ſaid, that Jeſus Chriſt is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places at the ſame time, in the <hi>Hoſts</hi> which are carried in very different manners; But neither for this is there any Text of Scripture. You will ſay, this may be; I anſwer, the Queſtion here is not of the Infinite power of Jeſus Chriſt, but
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:60616:13"/>of his Will, and which we muſt obey when it is known to us; and of this as to the preſent point we read nothing in the Holy Scripture. The ſhorter way then would be to ſay, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of one Pariſh is not the ſame with that of another, although both the one and the other concur in the ſame deſign to worſhip God; as the Paſchal Lamb of one Family, was not the Lamb of another, although both the one and the other were to accompliſh the ſame Myſtery. Thus for inſtance, on <hi>Corpus Chriſti-day,</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of S. <hi>Germain d' Auxerrois,</hi> where the perpetual Vicar conſecrates the Hoſt, and <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Dean, the firſt <hi>Curé,</hi> carrys it the Proceſſion under a rich Canopy crown'd with Flowers, this Hoſt is not the ſame with that of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s which is carried after another manner, <hi>viz.</hi> the Image of that Apoſtle made of Silver gilt, falling from his Horſe at his Converſion, under the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Jeſus Chriſt hung up in rays of Gold, and carried under the covering of another ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Canopy; and ſo of all the other Churches.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſtories of ſeveral <hi>Hoſts</hi> that have been ſtabb'd with Penknives, and have bled, they ſerve only to bring in ſome ſuperſtition contrary to the word of God, which never pretended that there was material <hi>Blood</hi> in the conſecrated <hi>Bread,</hi> becauſe it is the <hi>Body</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt in <hi>a myſtery of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For what is ſaid of an <hi>Infant</hi> that was ſeen in the ſtead of the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> and of the figure of Chriſt ſitting upon a <hi>Sepulshre</hi> inſtead of the ſame <hi>Hoſt,</hi> are meer <hi>Fables</hi> ſuggeſted by the <hi>Father of Lies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:60616:13"/>
                  <p>It is further reported of certain Robbers that carrying away the Veſſel in which the <hi>Hoſt</hi> is kept, they have thrown the <hi>Hoſt</hi> it ſelf upon the ground, and trampled it under foot, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have caſt it into naſty places, without any fear that it ſhould avenge it ſelf; This is a moſt horrible thought, and of which we ought not to open our mouths, but only to deteſt ſo dreadful a profanation.</p>
                  <p>The ſame muſt be ſaid of thoſe <hi>Hoſts</hi> which have been caſt up, as ſoon as received, whether by ſick perſons, or ſometimes by debauched Prieſts, diſordered with the laſt nights intemperance; both which have ſometimes happened, not to ſay any thing of thoſe other terrible inconveniences, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd in the Cautions concerning the <hi>Maſs.</hi> All which ſhew that Men have carry'd things too far, without any warrant from the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>It is not therefore ſo eaſie, as ſome imagine, to maintain the Doctrine of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> out of the Uſe, againſt the Opinions of any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Truth is terribly obſcured, and few give themſelves the trouble to clear it. On the contrary it ſeems that among the many Writers of the Age, there are ſome who make it their whole buſineſs to hide it, and to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from finding it out, as if they deſired never to be wiſer than they are. The vanity of lying flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters them but too much in all the Humane paſſions which ſway them.</p>
                  <p>There are nevertheleſs ſome faithful Diſciples, and Apoſtolick Souls who are exempted, to obey
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:60616:14"/>God by his Grace, and to give glory to his Name. It was not long before his departure that <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Every man is a lyar:</hi> Pſal. 115.2. and S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> 3.4. to ſhow that God only is true, adds immediately after from <hi>Pſalm</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And then Laſtly, for the main thing of all, The</hi> Sacrifice of the Maſs; <hi>it is clear that if.</hi> Chriſt's Body <hi>be not</hi> truly <hi>and</hi> properly <hi>there, it cannot be</hi> truly <hi>and</hi> properly offer'd; <hi>nor any of thoſe great benefits be derived to them from a</hi> morſel of Bread, <hi>which themſelves declare can proceed only from the</hi> Fleſh <hi>and</hi> Blood of <hi>their Bleſſed Lord.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>A ſecond</hi> Conſideration <hi>which I would beg leave to offer from the fore-going inſtances is this: What reliance we can make upon the</hi> Pretended Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <hi>of their</hi> Church; <hi>when 'tis thus plain that ſo many of the moſt learned Men of their own</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <hi>did not only not believe it to be</hi> Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>but ſuppoſed it to have</hi> actually Erred, <hi>and that in thoſe very Doctrines that are at this day eſteemed the moſt conſiderable</hi> Points <hi>in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:60616:19"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is plain from what has been ſaid in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> reflection, <hi>that disbelieving</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>they muſt alſo have lookt upon all the other Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> Adoration of the Hoſt, <hi>the</hi> Sacrifice of the Maſs, &amp;c. <hi>as Erroneous too. Now though it be not yet agreed among them, nor ever likely to be, where the</hi> ſuppoſed Infallibility <hi>of their</hi> Church <hi>is ſeated, yet ſince all manner of Authority has conſpired to eſtabliſh theſe things;</hi> Popes <hi>have</hi> decreed <hi>them,</hi> Councils defined <hi>them, and both</hi> Popes <hi>and</hi> Councils anathematized <hi>all thoſe that ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to doubt of them; 'tis evident either theſe Men did not believe the</hi> Church <hi>to be</hi> Infallible, <hi>as is pretended; or they did not believe the</hi> Roman, <hi>to be, according to the modern phraſe, indeed the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>And upon the ſame grounds there will ariſe a third</hi> Reflection, <hi>which they may pleaſe to make with us; and that is, with what Reaſon they can preſs us with the</hi> Authority <hi>of their</hi> Church <hi>in theſe matters; when ſuch eminent perſons of their own</hi> Communion, <hi>and who certainly were much more Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to it than we can be thought to be, yet did not eſteem it ſufficient to enſlave their belief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a reproach generally caſt upon us, that we ſet up a</hi> private Spirit <hi>in oppoſition to the</hi> Wiſdom <hi>and</hi> Authority <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>of God: and think our ſelves better able to</hi> judge <hi>in matters of</hi> Faith, <hi>than the moſt</hi> General Council <hi>that was ever yet aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled. This is uſually ſaid, but is indeed a foul</hi> Miſrepreſentation <hi>of our Opinion. All we ſay is, that every Man ought to</hi> act Rationally <hi>in matters of</hi> Religion, <hi>as well as in</hi> other <hi>concerns; to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:60616:19"/>his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding with the utmoſt skill and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that he is able, to know God's will, and what it is that he requires of us. We do not ſet up our</hi> own judgments <hi>againſt the</hi> Authority of the Church; <hi>but having both the Holy</hi> Oracles <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>and the</hi> Definitions of Men <hi>before us, we give to each their proper weight. And therefore if the</hi> one <hi>at any time contradicts the</hi> other, <hi>we reſolve, as is moſt fitting, not that</hi> our own, <hi>but</hi> God's Authority <hi>revealed to us in his</hi> Word, <hi>is to be preferred. And he who without this</hi> examination <hi>ſervilely gives up himſelf to follow whatever is required of him; He may be in the right, if his</hi> Church <hi>or</hi> Guide <hi>be ſo; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this method ſhall never be able to give a</hi> reaſon <hi>of his</hi> Faith; <hi>nor if he chance to be born in a</hi> Falſe Religion, <hi>ever be in a capacity of being better inſtructed. For if we muſt be allowed nothing but to obey only, and not preſume to</hi> enquire <hi>why; He that is a</hi> Jew <hi>muſt continue a</hi> Jew <hi>ſtill; he that is a</hi> Turk, <hi>a</hi> Turk; <hi>a</hi> Proteſtant <hi>muſt always be a</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant: <hi>In ſhort, in whatſoever</hi> profeſſion <hi>any one now is, in that he muſt continue, whether</hi> true <hi>or</hi> falſe, <hi>if</hi> reaſon <hi>and</hi> examination <hi>muſt be excluded all place in</hi> matters <hi>of</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">All this is lately granted by the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Cap. VI.</note> 
                  <hi>And indeed after all their clamours againſt us on this occaſion, yet is this no more than what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves require of us when 'tis in order to their own advantage. Is a</hi> Proſelyte <hi>to be made, they offer to him their Arguments: They tell him a long ſtory of their</hi> Church; <hi>the</hi> Succeſſion, Viſibility, <hi>and other Notes of it. To what purpoſe is all this, if we are not to be</hi> Judges, <hi>to examine their pretences whether theſe are ſufficient marks of ſuch a Church as they ſuppoſe; and if they are, whether they do indeed agree to theirs, and then upon
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:60616:20"/>a full conviction ſubmit to them. Now if this be their intention, 'tis then clear, let them pretend what they will, that they think us both capable of</hi> judging <hi>in theſe matters, and that we ought to follow that, which all things conſidered we find to be moſt</hi> reaſonable, <hi>which is all that we deſire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for this we have here the undoubted</hi> Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>of thoſe Eminent</hi> Perſons <hi>of their</hi> own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <hi>before named; who notwithſtanding the</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>of their</hi> Church, <hi>and the</hi> deciſion <hi>of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Councils <hi>eſteemed by it as</hi> General, <hi>have yet both thought themſelves at liberty to</hi> examine their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, <hi>and even to paſs ſentence too upon them, that they were erroneous in the</hi> Points <hi>here mentioned. And therefore certainly we may modeſtly deſire the ſame liberty which themſelves take; at leaſt till we can be convinced, (and that by ſuch Arguments as we ſhall be allow'd to judge of,) that there is ſuch an</hi> infallible Guide <hi>whom we ought in all things to follow without further inquiry, and where we may find him; and when this is done I will for my part promiſe as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give up my ſelf to his Conduct, as I am till then, I think reaſonably, reſolved to follow what according to the beſt of my ability in</hi> proving all things, <hi>I ſhall find indeed to be</hi> Good.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>I might from the ſame</hi> Principles, <hi>Fourthly, argue the</hi> Reaſonableneſs <hi>of our</hi> Reformation, <hi>at leaſt in the opinion of thoſe great Men of whom we have hitherto been ſpeaking: And who thinking it allow'd to them to diſſent themſelves from the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> Doctrine <hi>of their</hi> Church, <hi>which they found to be erroneous, could not but in their Conſciences ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us, who, as</hi> a national Church, <hi>no way ſubjected
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:60616:20"/>to their</hi> Authority, <hi>did the ſame; and by the right which every ſuch</hi> Church <hi>has within it ſelf,</hi> reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>thoſe</hi> Errors, <hi>which like the</hi> Tares <hi>were ſprung up with the</hi> Good Seed. <hi>This 'tis evident they muſt have approved; and for one of them, the</hi> Abbot of Ville-loyne, <hi>I have been aſſured by ſome of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Acquaintance, that he had always a particular reſpect for the</hi> Church of England, <hi>and which others of their</hi> Communion <hi>at this day eſteem to be neither</hi> Heretical <hi>nor</hi> Schiſmatical.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>But I may not inſiſt on theſe things, and will therefore finiſh this</hi> Addreſs <hi>with this only</hi> remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance <hi>to them; That ſince it is thus evident, that for above</hi> 1200 <hi>years this</hi> Doctrine <hi>was never</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd <hi>in the</hi> Church, <hi>nor till then, in the opinion of their own moſt learned Men, any</hi> matter of Faith; <hi>ſince the Greateſt of their Writers in the</hi> paſt Ages <hi>have declared themſelves ſo freely concerning it as we have ſeen above, and ſome of the moſt eminent of their</hi> Communion <hi>in the</hi> preſent <hi>have ingenuouſly acknowledged that they could not believe it; ſince 'tis confeſs'd that the</hi> Scripture <hi>does not require it;</hi> Senſe <hi>and</hi> Reaſon <hi>undoubtedly oppoſe it, and the</hi> Primitive Ages <hi>of the</hi> Church, <hi>as one of their own</hi> Authors <hi>has very lately ſhewn, received it not; They will at leaſt ſuffer all theſe things to diſpoſe them to an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Examination,</hi> wherefore at laſt it is that they do believe this great Error?

               <head>INTRODUCTION. <hi>Of the Nature of this</hi> HOLY SACRAMENT <hi>in the General.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TO underſtand the true deſign of our Bleſſed Saviour, in the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> we cannot, I ſuppoſe, take any better courſe than to conſider firſt of all, what Account the Sacred Writers have left us of the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of the doing of it.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60616:25"/>
               <p>Now for this St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 Cor. 11.23. "<hi>That the Lord Jeſus the ſame night in which he was betray'd</hi> (having firſt eaten the Paſſover according to the Law, Exod. 12. Matt. xxvi. 20.) <hi>took Bread, and</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>when he had given thanks he brake it,
<note n="*" place="margin">Matt. xxvi.</note> and gave it to the Diſciples, and ſaid, Take, Eat, This is my Body which is broken for you, This do in Remembrance of Me. After the ſame manner alſo he took the Cup when he had ſupp'd, ſaying, This Cup is the</hi> New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament <hi>in my Blood: This do ye, as oft as ye Drink it in Remembrance of me.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Such is the Account which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us of the <hi>Original</hi> of this <hi>Holy Sacrament:</hi> Nor do the Evangeliſts diſſent from it; only that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> with reference to the <hi>Cup,</hi> adds, <hi>Drink ye ALL of it,</hi> Matt. xxvi. 27. to which St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſubjoins a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Obſervation, and which ought not here to be paſs'd by, "That <hi>they ALL drank of it,</hi> Mark xiv. 23.</p>
               <p>It is not to be doubted, but that the deſign of our Bleſſed Saviour in <hi>inſtituting</hi> this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> was to Aboliſh the <hi>Jewiſh Paſſover,</hi> and to eſtabliſh the Memory of another, and a much greater <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,</hi> than that of the firſt-born, now to be wrought for the whole World in his Death. The <hi>Bread</hi> which he <hi>brake,</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> which he <hi>poured out,</hi> being ſuch clear <hi>Types</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> to be <hi>broken,</hi> his <hi>Blood</hi> to be <hi>ſhed</hi> for the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that it is impoſſible for us to doubt of the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>And as God Almighty under the Law, deſigned that other Memorial of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> now changed into a ſo much better and more excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, to continue as long as the Law its ſelf
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60616:25"/>ſtood in force: So this Bleſſed <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by Chriſt in the room of it, muſt no doubt have been intended by Him, to be continued in his Church, as long as the <hi>Covenant</hi> ſeal'd with that <hi>Blood</hi> which it exhibits, ſtands: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſince <hi>that</hi> ſhall never be aboliſh'd; 'tis evident that <hi>this</hi> alſo will remain our Duty, and be our perpetual Obligation to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>This is the import of our Saviours Addition, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of Me;</hi> and is by St. <hi>Paul</hi> more fully expreſſed in thoſe Words, which he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſubjoyns to the Hiſtory of the Inſtitution before recited, 1 Cor. xi. 26. <q>
                     <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew,</hi> i.e. in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Phraſe, ſet forth, Commemorate <hi>the Lords Death till his coming.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And that this Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> now eſtabliſh'd in the place of the <hi>Jewiſh Paſſover,</hi> might be both the better underſtood, and the eaſier received by them; it is a thing much to be remarked for the right ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of it, how exactly he accommodated all the Notions and Ideas of that Ancient <hi>Ceremony</hi> to this new <hi>Inſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. In that <hi>Paſchal Supper,</hi> the Maſter of the Houſe took <hi>Bread,</hi> and preſenting it before them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the uſual <hi>Benediction of the Bread,</hi> He brake it, and gave it to them, ſaying,

               <p>So clear an Alluſion does every part of this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> bear to that ancient <hi>Solemnity;</hi> and we muſt be more blind than the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, not to ſee, that as that other <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was inſtituted by Chriſt from the Practiſe and Cuſtom of the

                  <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, who received their Proſelytes by the like waſhing; ſo was this Holy <hi>Euchariſt</hi> eſtabliſht upon the Analogy which we have ſeen to the <hi>Paſchal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> whoſe place it ſupplies, and whoſe Ceremonies it ſo exactly retains, that it ſeems only to have heightned the deſign, and changed the Application to a more excellent Remembrance.</p>
               <p>I know not how far it may be allow'd to confirm this Analogie, That it was one of the moſt ancient Traditions among the
<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Fagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. in Exod. xii. 13. where he renders their words thus, <hi>"Et in eadem die viz.</hi> xv. <hi>menſis Niſan, ſc. Martii, redimendus eſt Iſrael in die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Meſſiae. Vid. Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>Critic. M.</hi> p 498.</note> 
                  <hi>Jews</hi> of old, that the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> ſhould come and work out their deliverance, <hi>The very ſame night in which God had brought them out of Egypt, the night of the Paſchal Solemnity.</hi> But
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60616:27"/>certainly conſiderable it is, that as God under the Law, the ſame night in which he deliver'd them, inſtituted the <hi>Paſſover</hi> to be a perpetual <hi>Memorial</hi> of it throughout their Generations; ſo here our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour inſtituted his <hi>Communion</hi> not only in the ſame Night in which he deliver'd us, but immediately after having eaten His laſt <hi>Paſſover;</hi> to ſhew us, that what that <hi>Solemnity</hi> had hitherto been to the <hi>Jews,</hi> this <hi>Sacrament</hi> ſhould from henceforth be to <hi>us;</hi> and that we by this Ceremony ſhould comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate ours, as they by that other had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do their Deliverance.</p>
               <p>This the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> themſelves direct us to, by ſo often calling our Bleſſed Saviour in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, "<hi>The Lamb of God, Joh.</hi> i. 29. St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of our Redemption wrought by Him, tells us, that it was not obtained by <q>
                     <hi>corruptible things, ſuch as ſilver and gold, but by the precious Blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot,</hi>
                  </q> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 18. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo clearly directs us to this alluſion, that no poſſible doubt can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main of it; <q>
                     <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>our Paſſover is ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for us, thereſore let us keep the Feaſt,</hi>
                  </q> 2 Cor. 1. v. 7.</p>
               <p>And now after ſo many Arguments for this <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> as, being joined together, I think I might almoſt call a Demonſtration of it; I ſuppoſe I may without ſcruple lay down this foundation both for the unfolding of the nature of this Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> in the General, and for the Examination of thoſe two great <hi>points</hi> I am here to conſider in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Saviour in this <hi>Inſtitution</hi> addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf to <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſpeaking in the direct
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60616:27"/>form of the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Phraſes; and in a <hi>Ceremony</hi> which 'tis thus evident he deſigned to introduce in the ſtead of that <hi>Solemnity;</hi> The beſt method we can take for explaining both the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>intent</hi> of this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> will be to examine what ſuch men to whom he ſpake muſt neceſſarily have conceived to be his meaning, but eſpecially on an occaſion wherein it neither became him to be obſcure; and the Apoſtles ſilence, not one of them demanding any explication of his words, as at other times they were wont to do, clearly ſhewing that he was not difficult to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>This only <hi>Poſtulate</hi> being granted, which I think I have ſo good reaſon to expect; I ſhall now go on to examine by it, the firſt great <hi>Point</hi> propoſed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of Chriſt in this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> and that</p>

                  <p>Such is the Account which themſelves give of this <hi>Myſtery:</hi> From all which we may in ſhort conclude the State of the Queſtion before us, to be this; That we do not diſpute at all about Chriſt's <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> which after a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Heavenly</hi> manner, we acknowledg in this Holy Euchariſt, as we ſhall hereafter ſhew; nor by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the <hi>Truth</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Words</hi> which we undoubtedly believe: But only about this <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of his <hi>Preſence, viz.</hi> Whether the <hi>Bread</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60616:29"/>the <hi>Wine</hi> be changed into the very natural <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, ſo that the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> themſelves do no longer remain; But that under the <hi>Appearance</hi> of them is contain'd that ſame <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> of Chriſt, which was <hi>Born</hi> of the Bleſſed <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> with his <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Divinity;</hi> which ſame <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> of Chriſt, tho <hi>extended</hi> in all its parts in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is at the ſame time in the Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Extenſion,</hi> neither <hi>Great</hi> nor <hi>Small,</hi> comes thither neither by <hi>Generation,</hi> nor by <hi>Creation,</hi> nor by any <hi>local Motion;</hi> foraſmuch as it continues ſtill at the right Hand of God in Heaven, at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame inſtant that it exiſts <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>intire</hi> in every conſecrated <hi>Host,</hi> or <hi>Chalice;</hi> nay more, is <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>intire,</hi> not only in the <hi>whole Host,</hi> or the <hi>whole Chalice;</hi> but in every the <hi>leaſt Crumb</hi> of the <hi>Host,</hi> and every the <hi>leaſt Drop</hi> of the <hi>Chalice,</hi> here upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>And here it might well be thought a very needleſs, indeed an extravagant undertaking, to prove that thoſe Elements, which ſo many of our Senſes tell us, continue after their Conſecration the very ſame, as to what concerns their <hi>natural Subſtance,</hi> that they were before, are in reality the very ſame: That what all the World <hi>Sees,</hi> and <hi>Feels,</hi> and <hi>Smells,</hi> and <hi>Taſts,</hi> to be <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> is not changed into the very natural <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of a Body actually before exiſtent; had it not entred into the Minds of ſo great a part of the Chriſtian Church to joyn in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a <hi>Paradox,</hi> which has nothing to defend it, but that fond Preſumption they have certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done well to take up, That they cannot poſſibly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60616:30"/>be in the <hi>wrong,</hi> and without which it would be very difficult for them to perſwade any ſober man that they are here in the <hi>right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſhew that thoſe <hi>words,</hi> which they tell us, work all this <hi>Miracle,</hi> and are the only reaſon that engages them to maintain ſo many abſurdities as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly the unavoidable Conſequences of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, have no ſuch force nor interpretation as they pretend; I muſt deſire it may be remembred what I before remark'd, That this Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> was eſtabliſh'd by our Saviour in the room of the <hi>Jewiſh Paſſever,</hi> and upon the very <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of it. So that, if in that all things were <hi>Typical;</hi> the <hi>Feaſt,</hi> the <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> the <hi>Expreſſions</hi> merely <hi>allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> to ſomething that had been done before, and of which this ſacred Ceremony was the <hi>memorial;</hi> we ought in all reaſon to conclude, that both our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our muſt have deſigned, and his Apoſtles underſtood this Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> to have been the ſame too.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Paſſover;</hi> we have already ſeen that it was appointed by God as a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of his delivery of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when he ſlew all the <hi>firſt-born</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians, Exod.</hi> xii.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now all theſe <hi>Idea's</hi> with which the Apoſtles had ſo long been acquainted, could not but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſuggeſt to them the ſame deſign of our Bleſſed Saviour in the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of this Holy <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:</hi> That when <hi>He,</hi> as the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Feaſt,</hi> took the <hi>Loaf, Bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>brake</hi> it, and <hi>gave</hi> it to them, and Bid them in like manner henceforward, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of Him;</hi> He certainly deſigned that by this Ceremony, which hitherto they had uſed in <hi>memory</hi> of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they ſhould now continue the <hi>memory</hi> of their Bleſſed Lord, and of that deliverance which he was about to work for them. That as by calling the <hi>Lamb</hi> in that Feaſt "The <hi>Body of the Paſſover,</hi> they underſtood that it was the <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of God's mercy in commanding the <hi>deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angel</hi> to <hi>paſs over</hi> their Houſes when he ſlew their Enemies; the <hi>memorial</hi> of the <hi>Lamb</hi> which was killed for this purpoſe in <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo Chriſt calling the <hi>Bread</hi> his <hi>Body,</hi> nay, his <hi>Body broken</hi> for

                  <p>This is ſo natural a reflection, and in one Part at leaſt of this Holy Sacrament ſo neceſſary too, that 'tis impoſſible to explain it otherwiſe. <q>

                  <p>So naturally do all theſe Notions direct us to a <hi>figurative</hi> interpretation of his Words; the whole <hi>deſign</hi> of this <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and all the <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> of it being plainly <hi>Typical,</hi> in <hi>Remembrance</hi> (as Chriſt himſelf has told us) <hi>of Him.</hi> But now if we go on more particularly to inquire into the Expreſſion its ſelf, <hi>This is my Body which is broken for you,</hi> That will yet more clearly confirm this interpretation.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60616:31"/>
                  <p>It has before been obſerved, That theſe words of our Saviour in this Holy <hi>Sacrament,</hi> were uſed by him inſtead of that other Expreſſion of the <hi>Maſter</hi> in the <hi>Paſchal Feaſt,</hi> when in the very ſame manner he took the very ſame <hi>Bread</hi> into his Hands, and <hi>bleſſed</hi> it, and <hi>brake</hi> it, and <hi>gave</hi> it to thoſe who were at the Table with Him, ſaying, <hi>This is the Bread of affliction which our Fathers ate in Egypt.</hi> And can any thing in the world be more plain, than that as never any <hi>Jew</hi> yet imagined, that the <hi>Bread</hi> which they thus took every year, was by that ſaying of the <hi>Maſter</hi> of their Feaſt changed into the very <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of that <hi>Bread</hi> which their forefathers had ſo many Ages before conſumed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the night of their deliverance; but being thus broken and given to them, became a <hi>Type,</hi> a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi> a <hi>Memorial</hi> of it: So neither could thoſe to whom our Saviour Chriſt now ſpake, and who as being <hi>Jews</hi> had ſo long been uſed to this <hi>Phraſe,</hi> ever imagine, that the pieces of that <hi>Loaf</hi> which He <hi>brake,</hi> and <hi>gave</hi> them, ſaying, <q>
                        <hi>This is my Body which is broken for you, Do this in Remembrance of me,</hi>
                     </q> became thereupon the <hi>very Body</hi> of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour from whoſe Hands they received it; and who did not ſure with one <hi>member</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> give away his <hi>whole Body</hi> from himſelf to them; but only deſigned that by this Ceremony they ſhould <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> Him, and his <hi>Body broken</hi> for them, as by the ſame they had hitherto <hi>remembred</hi> the <hi>Bread of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which their Fathers ate in Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ought not to omit it, becauſe it very much confirms the force of this Argument, That what I have here ſaid of this <hi>Analogy</hi> of the Holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> to the

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60616:32"/>evidently prove <hi>Bread</hi> to be Chriſts <hi>Body,</hi> as thoſe other in St. <hi>John, I am the Bread that came down from Heaven,</hi> argue a contrary <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>Body</hi> into <hi>Bread,</hi> John vi. 48, 51. or thoſe more uſual inſtances, <hi>I am the true Vine; I am the door of the ſheep; That Rock was Chriſt;</hi> prove a great many <hi>Tranſubſtantiations</hi> more, <hi>viz.</hi> of our Saviour into a <hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Door,</hi> and a <hi>Rock.</hi> But now, if for all this plainneſs and poſitiveneſs in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, they themſelves tell us, That it would be ridiculous to conclude from hence, that Chriſt was indeed turned into all theſe, and many other the like things; they may pleaſe to give us leave to ſay the ſame of this before us, it being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſs impoſſible, nor leſs unreaſonable to ſuppoſe <hi>Bread</hi> to be changed into Chriſt's <hi>Body,</hi> than for Chriſt's <hi>Body</hi> to be changed into <hi>Bread,</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Door,</hi> a <hi>Rock,</hi> or whatever you pleaſe of the like kind.</p>
                  <p>But I have already ſhewn the ground of this miſtake to be their want of conſidering the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms</hi> and <hi>Phraſes</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh Paſſover,</hi> and upon which, both the Holy <hi>Euchariſt</hi> it ſelf, and theſe <hi>Expreſſions</hi> in it were founded: And I will only add this farther, in confirmation of it; That in the Stile of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language in general, there is nothing more ordinary, than for things to be ſaid to

                  <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that this is an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way of explaining indeed, and becomes the Character of a Church whoſe dictates are to be <hi>received,</hi> not <hi>examined;</hi> and may therefore paſs well enough amongſt thoſe, with whom the ſuppoſed <hi>Infallibility</hi> of their <hi>Guides,</hi> is thought a ſufficient diſpenſation for their own <hi>private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</hi> But for us, who can ſee no reaſon for this ſudden change of our Saviours Diſcourſe;

                     <p>An Argument this, which ſince it cannot be Anſwered, they ſeem reſolved to run it down; as the <hi>Stoick</hi> in <hi>Lucian,</hi> who began to call names, when he had nothing elſe to ſay for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Senſes</hi> are ſuch ill <hi>Informers,</hi> that they may not be truſted in matters of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would theſe Diſputers pleaſe to tell us, What <hi>Authority</hi> they have for the truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion?</hi> Was not Chriſtianity firſt found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>Miracles</hi> of our Bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles?

Have we any other Argument to warrant our belief of theſe, but what comes to us by the miniſtry of our <hi>Senſes?</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">John xx. 27, 29.</note> Did not Chriſt himſelf appeal to them for the proof of his own <hi>Riſing?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romanist</hi> himſelf believes <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> becauſe he reads in the Scripture, or rather (to ſpeak more agreeably to the method of their Church) becauſe he has been told there are ſuch Words there, as, <hi>Hee eſt Corpus Meum:</hi> Now not to enquire how far thoſe words will ſerve to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant this Doctrine, is it not evident that he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60616:42"/>cannot be ſure there are any ſuch words there, if he may not truſt his <hi>Senſes:</hi> And if he may, is it not as plain, That he muſt ſeek for ſome other meaning than what they give of them?</p>
                     <p>Let us ſuppoſe the change they ſpeak of to be Supernatural; Be it as much a <hi>Miracle</hi> as they deſire: The very Character of a <hi>Miracle</hi> is to be known by the <hi>Senſes.</hi> Nor God, nor Chriſt, nor any Prophet or Apoſtle, ever pretended to any other. And I ſhall leave it to any one to judge what progreſs Chriſtianity would have made in the World, if it had had no other <hi>Miracles</hi> but ſuch as <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> to confirm it: <hi>i. e.</hi> Great Wonders confidently aſſerted, but ſuch as every ones <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> would tell him were both falſely aſſerted, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be performed.</p>

                     <p>Our Church indeed teaches us to believe, That the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> continue ſtill in their True and Natural <hi>Subſtance;</hi> but it teaches us

                     <p>The Primitive Fathers, of whom we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken, ſufficiently aſſure us, that they were ſtrangers to that <hi>Corporeal change</hi> that is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; but for this <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Myſtical,</hi> they have openly enough declared for it.</p>
                     <p>Nor are we therefore afraid to confeſs a <hi>change,</hi> and that a very great one too made in this Holy <hi>Sacrament.</hi> The <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> which we here Conſecrate, ought not to be given or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any one in this <hi>Mystery,</hi> as <hi>common</hi> ordinary food. Thoſe Holy Elements which the Prayers of the Church have <hi>ſanctified,</hi> and the Divine Words of our Bleſſed Saviour applied to them, though not <hi>Tranſubſtantiated,</hi> yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſeparated to a Holy uſe and ſignification, ought to be regarded with a very juſt Honour by us: And whilſt we Worſhip Him whoſe Death we herein Commemorate, and of whoſe Grace we expect to be made partakers by it, we ought certainly to pay no little regard to the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> by which he has choſen to repreſent the <hi>one,</hi> and convey to us the <hi>other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus therefore we think we ſhall beſt divide our Piety, if we <hi>Adore</hi> our Redeemer in <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet omit nothing that may teſtifie our juſt eſteem of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60616:44"/>his Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> on <hi>Earth:</hi> Nor ſuffer the moſt Zealous Votary for this new Opinion, to exceed us in our Care and Reverence of Approaching to his Holy Table.</p>
                     <p>We acknowledg him to be no leſs <hi>Really</hi> Preſent, tho after another <hi>manner</hi> than they; nor do we leſs expect to Communicate of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> with our <hi>Souls,</hi> than they who think they take Him car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally into their <hi>Mouths.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let our <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> be examined; let the Reverence and Devotion, with which we Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate this Sacred Feaſt, be conſider'd; all theſe will ſhew how far the Church of <hi>England</hi> is from a light eſteem of this great <hi>Myſtery;</hi> indeed, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any to ſet a higher Value and Reverence upon it.</p>

                  <p>IT may ſufficiently appear from what has been ſaid in the foregoing Chapter, what juſt reaſon we have to reject that kind of <hi>Preſence</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuppoſes of Chriſt in this <hi>Holy Euchariſt.</hi> But now in Anſwer to our Reflections upon them on this Occaſion,

                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60616:46"/>and of thoſe abroad, ſuch as <hi>Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe <q>Doctrine, amongſt all the reſt, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſeems rather to have embraced and agreed with, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince the beginning of the <hi>Reformation</hi> by Q. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi>

                     </q> which not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the preſent Declaration of our Church; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>That <hi>the Natural Body of Chriſt is not in in this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament;</hi>

                        <hi>That it is against the Truth of a Natural Body to be in more places than One at One time;</hi>

                  <p>This is, I think, the deſign of the former of thoſe Diſcourſes lately Printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Real Preſence; and in Anſwer to which, that I may proceed as diſtinctly as poſſible, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce my Reflections to theſe Four Generals:
<list>
                        <item>1. What is the true Notion of the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> as acknowledged by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. That this has been the Notion conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the Generality of our Divines.</item>
                        <item>3. That the <hi>Alteration</hi> of the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> as to this matter, was not upon any ſuch difference in their Opinions, as this <hi>Author</hi> ſeems to ſurmiſe.</item>
                        <item>4. That the Reaſon alledged by it, concerning the Impoſſibility of Chriſt's <hi>Natural Body</hi>'s exiſting in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60616:46"/>ſeveral places at the ſame time, is no way invalida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any of his Exceptions againſt it.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I enter on theſe <hi>Reflections,</hi> I cannot but obſerve the unreaſonableneſs of our Adverſaries, in repeating continually the ſame Arguments againſt us without either adding of any the leaſt new force to them, or even taking notice of thoſe Replies that have more than once been made againſt them. The <hi>Publiſher</hi> of this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> has not been ſo indiligent an Obſerver of what has paſt under his Eyes, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to theſe kind of <hi>Controverſies,</hi> as not to know, that this very <hi>Objection,</hi> which is the Foundation of his <hi>Firſt Diſcourſe,</hi> was made by his Old Friend <hi>T. G.</hi> above Nine Years ſince; and fully anſwer'd by his Reverend and Learned <hi>Adverſary</hi> not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And therefore that he certainly ought either qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to have let alone this Argument already baffled, and not have put the World in Mind where that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſtopp'd; or, at leaſt, he ſhould have added ſome new ſtrength to it. But to ſend it again into the World in the ſame forlorn State it was before; to take no notice either from whoſe Store-houſe he borrow'd it, or what had been returned to it; This is in effect to confeſs, that they have no more to ſay for themſelves: And 'tis a ſad Cauſe indeed that has nothing to keep it up, but what they know very well we can anſwer, and that they themſelves are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the <hi>Points</hi> propoſed to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd: And, <q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſtate the Notion of the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> as acknowledged by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:60616:47"/>
                  <p>I muſt obſerve, 1ſt. That our <hi>Church</hi> utterly denies our Saviour's <hi>Body</hi> to be ſo <hi>Really Preſent</hi> in the Bleſſed <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as either to leave <hi>Heaven,</hi> or to exiſt in <hi>ſeveral places at the ſame time.</hi> We confeſs, with this Author,
<note place="margin">1. Tract. p. 19. §. 27.</note> that it would be no leſs a Contradiction for Chriſt's <hi>Natural Body,</hi> to be in ſeveral places at the ſame time by any other <hi>Mode</hi> whatſoever, than by that which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> has ſtated; the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy being in the <hi>thing its ſelf,</hi> and not in the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it.</hi> 2dly, That we deny that in the Sacred <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> which we receive, there is any other <hi>Subſtance</hi> than that of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> diſtributed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants; which alone they take into their Mouths, and preſs with their Teeth.
<note place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>T. G</hi>'s Dialogues. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1679. pag. 66.</note> In ſhort, <q>All which the Doctrine of our <hi>Church</hi> implies by this Phraſe, is only a <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of Chriſt's Inviſible <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> ſo in and with the <hi>Elements,</hi> as by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful receiving of them, to convey <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>real Effects</hi> to the Souls of Men. As the <hi>Bodies</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Angels, might be called their <hi>Bodies,</hi> while they aſſumed them; or rather, as the <hi>Church</hi> is the <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt, becauſe of his Spirit quickening and enlivening the Souls of Believers, ſo the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> after <hi>Conſecration,</hi> are the <hi>Real,</hi> but the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of Chriſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus has that learned Man, to whom <hi>T. G.</hi> firſt made this Objection, ſtated the Notion of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> profeſs'd by us; and that this is indeed the true <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is evident not only from the plain words of our <hi>xxviii. Article,</hi> and of our <hi>Church Catechiſm;</hi> but alſo from the whole Tenour of that <hi>Office</hi> which we uſe in the celebration of it. In our <hi>Exhortation</hi> to it, this Bleſſed Euchariſt is expreſly called <q>The <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60616:47"/>of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of our Saviour Chriſt:</q> We are told, <q>that if with a true Penitent Heart and lively Faith we receive this Holy Sacrament; then we <hi>Spiritually eat</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of Chriſt, and <hi>drink</hi> his <hi>Blood.</hi>
                     </q> When the Prieſt delivers the conſecrated <hi>Bread,</hi> he bids the Communicant <q>Take and eat this in Remembrance that Chriſt died for thee, and <hi>feed</hi> on him in thy <hi>Heart</hi> by Faith with Thanksgiving.</q> In our Prayer after the Receiving, <q>We thank God, for that he do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Now for what concerns our <hi>Divines</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi> vi<hi rend="sup">ths.</hi> time, we have our Authors own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that towards the latter end of the Reign of that excellent Prince, they ſeem to have deny'd any ſuch <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Eſſential preſence</hi> as he would faſten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> after. <q>For as the firſt days of this Prince,

                     <q>If we doubt, <hi>ſays he,</hi> what thoſe admirable words may import, let him be our Teacher for the meaning of Chriſt, to whom Chriſt was himſelf a School-maſter.

So that all that worthily communicate, do by <hi>Faith receive</hi> Chriſt <hi>Really, Effectually,</hi> to all the purpoſes of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on— It is <hi>Bread</hi> and it is <hi>Chriſts Body:</hi> It is <hi>Bread</hi> in in <hi>Subſtance,</hi> Chriſt in the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and Chriſt is as <hi>really</hi> given to all that are truly diſpos'd, as the <hi>Symbols</hi> are p. 183.—It is here as in the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for as there <hi>natural Water</hi> becomes the <hi>laver of Regeneration;</hi> ſo here <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> become the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt: but there and here too the firſt <hi>Substance</hi> is changed by <hi>Grace,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the <hi>ſame</hi> in <hi>nature</hi>—We ſay that Chriſts <hi>Body</hi> is in the Sacrament <hi>really,</hi> but <hi>Spiritually.</hi> They (the <hi>Papiſts</hi>) ſay it is there <hi>really,</hi> but <hi>Spiritually.</hi> For ſo <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> is bold to ſay that the word may be allowed in this Queſtion. Where now is the difference? Here; By <hi>Spiritually</hi> they mean preſent after the manner of a <hi>Spirit;</hi> by <hi>Spiritually</hi> we mean preſent to our <hi>Spirits only;</hi> that is, ſo as Chriſt is not preſent to any other Sence but that of <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſuſception—
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60616:58"/>They ſay that Chriſts <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>truly</hi> preſent there, as it was upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> but not after the <hi>manner</hi> of all, or any <hi>Body</hi>—But we by the <hi>real Spiritual Preſence</hi> of Chriſt, do underſtand Chriſt to be preſent, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is preſent in the Hearts of the faithful, by <hi>Bleſſing</hi> and <hi>Grace;</hi> and this is <hi>ALL we mean</hi> beſides the <hi>tropical</hi> and <hi>figurative</hi> preſence.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such is the Account which that Excellent Biſhop here gives not only of his own, but, as he expreſly terms, it of the <hi>Church of</hi> England's, <hi>and the Generality of the Proteſtants Belief in this Matter.</hi> Our Author's diſſimulation of it is ſo much the more inexcuſable,
<note place="margin">Treatiſe 1ſt. p. 20th.</note> by how much the more zealous an Advocate he makes him of his Cauſe, when all this that I have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, was in the very ſame Section, and almoſt in the ſame Page with what he has cited. For his little Remark upon the Title of the Biſhops Book, where he calls it of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> whence he would infer a difference between the two Terms, and find ſomething <hi>Real</hi> that is not <hi>Spiritual</hi> in this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> it is evident that the Deſign of that Diſtinction was this: There be ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Real Preſences;</hi> the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> all allow a <hi>Real Preſence</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but after dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Manners;</hi> it was therefore neceſſary to add ſomewhat more, to ſhew what kind of <hi>Real Preſence</hi> he undertook to maintain, and he knew no word more proper to expreſs it by than <hi>Spiritual,</hi> which does not therefore imply a Diſtinction from, but Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of the other Term <hi>Real.</hi> And thus he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it, <hi>N.</hi> 6. and 7. of that Section,
<note place="margin">Pag. 183.</note> where he ſhews that the <hi>Spiritual</hi> is alſo a <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> and indeed more properly ſo than any other. In ſhort, thus he concludes the State of the Queſtion,
<note place="margin">Pag 186.</note> in the ſame Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60616:59"/>between us and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that now, <hi>ſays he,</hi> The Queſtion is not, <q>Whether the <hi>Symbols</hi> be <hi>changed</hi> into Chriſt's <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> or no? For it is granted on all ſides: But whether this <hi>Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> be <hi>Sacramental</hi> and <hi>Figurative?</hi> Or whether it be <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Bodily?</hi> Nor is it whether Chriſt be taken <hi>Really,</hi> but whether he be taken in a <hi>Spiritual</hi> or in a <hi>Natural Manner?</hi> We ſay the Converſion is <hi>Figurative, Myſterious,</hi> and <hi>Sacramental;</hi> they ſay, it is <hi>Proper, Natural,</hi> and <hi>Corporal.</hi> We affirm that Chriſt is <hi>really taken</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> by the <hi>Spirit, to all real Effects</hi> of his Paſſion</q> (this is an Explication a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle different from our Authors) <q>They ſay he is taken by the <hi>Mouth,</hi> and that the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and the <hi>Virtual</hi> taking him in <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Effect,</hi> is not ſufficient, tho' done alſo in the Sacrament.</q> 
                     <hi>Hic Rhodus, hic Saltus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this does not yet ſatisfie him that he has injur'd this Learned Man in the Repreſentation of his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, directly contrary to his Senſe, I will offer him yet one Paſſage more, taken from another part of his Works, and which, I hope, will throughly convince him. It is in the 5th. Letter, to a Gentleman that was tempted to the Communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> He had propoſed to the Biſhop this Queſtion. <q>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without all danger of <hi>Superstition</hi> or <hi>Idolatry,</hi> we may not render Divine <hi>Worſhip</hi> to our Bleſſed Saviour, as preſent in the Bleſſed <hi>Sacrament</hi> or <hi>Hoſt,</hi> according to his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> in that <hi>Hoſt?</hi>
                     </q> The Queſtion is certainly every way pertinent to our preſent Purpoſe; let us ſee what the Anſwer is that he makes to it.

                  <p>To give a rational Account of this Affair, we muſt carefully conſider the Circumſtances of the Times, the Tempers and Diſpoſitions of the Perſons that lived in them; and what the Deſigns of the <hi>Governing</hi> Parties were with reference to them; and then we ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſee both a great deal of Wiſdom and Piety in the making of theſe <hi>Alterations;</hi> allowing the Opinions of thoſe who did it, to have continued, as we have ſeen, in all of them the ſame.</p>
                  <p>When firſt this <hi>Rubrick</hi> was put into King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Liturgy, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was but juſt riſing up out of the Errors and Superſtitions with which it had been over-run by the prevalency of <hi>Popery</hi> upon it. It had the happineſs to be <hi>reformed,</hi> not as moſt others were, by private perſons, and in many places contrary to the deſires of the <hi>Civil Power;</hi> but by a Unanimous Concurrence of the Higheſt <hi>Authority</hi> both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> Hence it came to paſs, that <hi>Convocations</hi> being aſſembled, <hi>Deliberations</hi> had of the greateſt and wiſeſt Perſons for the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, nothing was done out of a Spirit of Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſnneſs or Oppoſition; the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> were carefully conſulted; and all things examined according to the exacteſt meaſures that could be taken from them; and a diligent diſtinction made of what
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60616:61"/>was <hi>Popery,</hi> and what <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Catholick Chriſtianity,</hi> that ſo the One only might be rejected, the other duly retained.</p>
                  <p>Now by this means it was that the Ancient <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> became preſerved amongſt us; a juſt and wiſe <hi>Liturgy</hi> collected out of the <hi>Publick Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals:</hi> Whatever <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were requiſite for <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Decency,</hi> were retain'd; and among the reſt, that of receiving the <hi>Communion kneeling</hi> for One, which has accordingly ever ſince been the manner eſtabliſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. But that no Occaſion of Scandal might hereby be given, whether to our <hi>Neighbour-Churches</hi> abroad, or to any particular Members of our own at home: That thoſe who were yet weak in the Faith, might not either continue or fall back into Error, and by our retaining the ſame <hi>Ceremony</hi> in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> that they had been uſed to in the <hi>Maſs,</hi> fancy that they were to <hi>adore</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> as they did before: For all theſe great Ends this Caution was inſerted; that the true Intent of this <hi>Ceremony</hi> was only for <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> not that any <hi>Adoration</hi> was thereby <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, or ought to be done unto any Real or Eſſential Preſence of Chriſt's Natural Fleſh and Blood, which were not there, but in Heaven, it being againſt the Truth of Chriſt's Natural Body to be at One time in more places than One.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is ſufficiently intimated in the words of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> to have been the firſt Cauſe and Deſign of it. Thus it continued the remainder of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time: But now Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being come to the Crown, there were other Circumſtances to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd. Thoſe of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion abroad were ſufficiently ſatisfied, both by this <hi>publick Declaration,</hi> which had ſtood ſo many years in the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of our
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60616:62"/>
                     <hi>Church;</hi> and by the Converſation and Acquaintance of our Divines, forced by the diſperſion in the foregoing Reign, to ſeek forrefuge among their Brethren in other Countries, of our Orthodox Faith, as to this Point. Our own Members at home had heard too much of this matter in the publick Writings and Diſputations, and in the conſtant Sufferings of their <hi>Martyrs,</hi> not to know that the <hi>Popiſh Real Preſence</hi> was a meer Figment, an <hi>Idolum,</hi> as Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> juſtly ſtiles it; and their <hi>Maſs</hi> to be <hi>abhorred</hi> rather than <hi>adored.</hi> There was then no longer need of this <hi>Rubrick</hi> upon any of thoſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for which it was firſt eſtabliſh'd; and there was a very juſt reaſon now to lay it aſide. That great <hi>Queen</hi> deſired, if poſſible, to compoſe the Minds of her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and make up thoſe Diviſions which the differences of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the late unhappy Conſequences of them had occaſion'd. For this, ſhe made it her buſineſs to render the publick Acts of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> as agreeable to all Parties as Truth would permit. The Clauſe of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> inſerted in the <hi>Articles</hi> of her firſt <hi>Convocation,</hi> and <hi>ſubſcribed</hi> by all the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of it (to ſhew that their belief was ſtill the ſame it had ever been as to this matter) was nevertheleſs, as we have ſeen, ſtruck out for this end their next Seſſion. The Title of <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which her Father had firſt taken, her Brother continued, and was from both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to her, ſo qualified and explained, as might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any Occaſion of quarrelling at it by the moſt cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious perſons. That Petition in the <hi>Litany</hi> inſerted by King <hi>Henry</hi> viii. <q>
                        <hi>From the Tyranny of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and all his deteſtable Enormities, Good Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</q> ſtruck out: And in conformity to what was done in the <hi>Articles</hi> as to this Point, this <hi>Rubrick</hi> alſo was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, leſt it ſhould give <hi>Offence</hi> to thoſe who were ſtill
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60616:62"/>zealous for their miſtaken Principles and Worſhip. This was the Wiſe and Chriſtian Deſign of that Excellent <hi>Princeſs;</hi> and how happy an Effect this Moderation might have had, if the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had not by his Artifice and Authority with ſome of her Subjects, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, the firſt Years of her Reign ſufficiently ſhew.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the Occaſion and Reaſon of its omiſſion in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, as great as the neceſſity of its firſt Inſertion in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s. And in this ſtate it continued all the Reign of that <hi>Queen,</hi> and of her two Succeſſors, King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles.</hi> 1ſt, I ſhall not need to ſay by what means it was, that new Occaſion was given for the reviving of it. We have all of us heard, and many of us ſeen too much of it. How Order became Superſtitious, and Decency termed Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> traduced as but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name for <hi>Popery;</hi> and this <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of <hi>kneeling at the Communion,</hi> one of the ſtrongeſt Arguments of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for the Proof of it. And now when Panick Fears had found ſuch prevalence over the Minds of Men, as to deſtroy a King, and embroil a Kingdom into a <hi>Civil War,</hi> of almoſt Twenty Years continuance; and tho by the good hand of God our King and our Peace were again reſtored, yet the minds of the People were ſtill unſetled, and in danger of being again blown up upon the leaſt Occaſion; what could be more adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to juſtifie our ſelves from all ſuſpicion of <hi>Popery</hi> in this matter, and induce them to a <hi>Conformity</hi> with us in a <hi>Ceremony</hi> they had entertain'd ſuch a dread of, than to revive that ancient <hi>Rubrick;</hi> and ſo quiet the Minds of the People now, by the ſame means by which they had been ſetled and ſecured before?</p>
                  <p>This I am perſwaded is ſo <hi>rational</hi> an Account, as will both juſtifie the proceedings of our Governours in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60616:63"/>theſe Changes, and ſhew the diſ-ingenuity of thoſe, who not only knowing, but having been told theſe things, will ſtill rather impute it to an imaginary wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, or uncertainty of Opinion, than to a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Chriſtian Accommodation to the Times. For the change in the Prayer of <hi>Conſecration,</hi> I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid, that 'tis in the Words, not the Senſe: And if our Governours thought the preſent Expreſſions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> liable to exception than the former, they had certainly reaſon for the Alteration. For the other Exceptions there is very little in them, whether the Miniſter lay his Hand on the Sacred Elements, when he repeats the words of <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> as at this time, or only conſecrates them by the Prayers of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Words of Chriſt, without any other <hi>Ceremony,</hi> as heretofore: Whether with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> we uſe only the words of Chriſt in the diſtribution; or with moſt of the Reformed Churches, the other Expreſſion, <q>
                        <hi>Take and eat this,</hi> &amp;c.</q> or (as we chuſe rather) joyn them both together: Whether we ſing the <hi>Gloria in Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis Deo</hi>—before or after the receiving; but becauſe the chiefeſt Myſtery he thinks lies in this, That whereas in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days the <hi>Rubrick</hi> called it an <hi>Eſſential Preſence,</hi> which we have now turned into <hi>Corporeal;</hi> I muſt confeſs I will not undertake to ſay what the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it was; if they thought this latter manner more free from giving Offence than the other would have been, I think they did well to prefer it. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one entertain what Notion he pleaſes of theſe things; this I have ſhewn is the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> which we all ſubſcribe, <q>That the <hi>Natural Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of our Saviour Chriſt are in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and not <hi>here;</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Sacrament; and if there can be any other <hi>Real Preſence</hi> than ſuch as I have ſhewn to have been the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60616:63"/>conſtant belief of our Divines conſiſtent with this <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,</hi> I ſhall no more deſire to debar any one the belief of it, than I ſhall be willing to be obliged to believe it with him.</p>
                  <p>And now after ſo clear an Account as I have here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the ſeveral changes that have been made in our <hi>Rubrick,</hi> were I minded to recriminate, and tell the World what Alterations have been made in their Maſs, &amp; thoſe in Points infinitely more material than any thing that can be alledged againſt us, I much queſtion whether they would be able to give us ſo good an account of it. And ſo mething of this I may perhaps offer as a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen</hi> of the wiſdom of this Author in the choice of his Accuſation before we part; In the mean time I go on to the laſt thing propoſed to be here conſider'd.</p>
                  <q>4thly. that the <hi>Reaſon</hi> mention'd in our <hi>Rubrick</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> of Chriſts <hi>natural Body</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting in <hi>ſeveral places</hi> at the <hi>ſame time,</hi> is no way inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidated by any of this <hi>Authors</hi> exceptions againſt it.</q>
                  <p>Now theſe being moſt of them founded upon the former miſtaken Notion of the <hi>Real preſence</hi> falſely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, will admit of a very ſhort and plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>

We do not any of Us think it either ſafe or pious to be too nice in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining what God <hi>can,</hi> or <hi>cannot</hi> do; we leave that to the bold Inquiſitiveneſs of their <hi>Schools.</hi> But this we think we may ſay, that if there are any unalterable Laws of Nature, by which we are to judg of theſe things; then God can no more make <hi>one Body</hi> to exiſt in <hi>ten thouſand places</hi> at the <hi>ſame time,</hi> than he can make <hi>one,</hi> continuing <hi>one,</hi> to be <hi>ten thouſand,</hi> than he can <hi>divide</hi> the ſame thing from <hi>its ſelf,</hi> and yet continue it ſtill <hi>undivided.</hi> And if any of our Divines have ſaid, that they cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that one Body can be in ſeveral places at once, <q>till the Papiſts can demonſtrate the poſſibility thereof by Teſtimony of Holy Scripture, or the ancient Tradition of the Primitive Church, or by apparent Reaſon.</q> We need not ſuppoſe that they ſaid this, doubting whether it implied a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,</hi> but becauſe the certainty of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction</hi> ſecured them againſt the poſſibility of any ſuch Proof.

                  <p>I ſhall cloſe up this Diſcourſe of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> acknowledged by us in this Holy <hi>Sacrament,</hi> with a plain familiar Example, and which may ſerve at once both to illuſtrate, and confirm the Propriety of it. A Father makes his laſt <hi>Will,</hi> and by it bequeaths his <hi>Eſtate</hi> and all the Profits of it to his <hi>Child.</hi>

The <hi>Son</hi> in this caſe receives nothing but a <hi>Roll of Parchment,</hi> with a <hi>Seal</hi> tied to it from his <hi>Father;</hi> but yet by virtue of this <hi>Parchment</hi> he is intituled to his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Conditions of his <hi>Will,</hi> and to all the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Advantages of it: And in that <hi>Deed</hi> he <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> received <hi>the very Houſe</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi> that were thereby conveyed to him. Our Saviour Chriſt in like manner, being now about to leave the World, gives this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> as his final <hi>Bequeſt</hi> to us; in it he conveys to us a right to <hi>his Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and to all the <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from them.

<note place="margin">Treatiſe 1.

                  <p n="2">2. <q>Tho the <hi>Corporeal Preſence</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>Body,

                  <p>Now to this I ſhall at preſent only ſay, That the <hi>Suppoſition</hi> being <hi>abſurd,</hi> do's not admit of a <hi>rational</hi> Conſideration.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly; Concerning the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> he tells us, <q>That this word <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pag. 14. §. xi.</note> is not to be taken always in the ſame ſenſe; but ſometimes to be uſed to ſignify only the <hi>external Sign,</hi> or <hi>Symbols;</hi> ſometimes only the <hi>Res Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi> or the thing contain'd under them, which is the more principal part thereof.</q> This indeed is a ſort of new Divinity. I always thought hitherto, that when we talked of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> properly ſo
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60616:74"/>called, we had meant an <hi>outward and viſible Sign of an inward and ſpiritual Grace:</hi> and that this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Sacrament</hi> had been a whole compoſed of the <hi>External Species,</hi> (whatever they are) as the <hi>Sign;</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt as the <hi>inward part,</hi> or <hi>thing ſignified.</hi> Thus I am ſure the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> inſtructs us. Firſt, for the name; it tells us,
<note place="margin">Catech. ad Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach. part 2. de Sacram. n. iii. &amp; v. p. 92.</note> that <q>
                        <hi>The Latin Doctors have thought that certain Signs, ſubjected to the Senſes, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and as it were ſet before the Eyes, the Grace which they effect, may fitly be called Sacraments.</hi>
                     </q> And for the <hi>nature</hi> of them, thus it defines a <hi>Sacrament</hi> from S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> 
                     <q>It is the <hi>ſign</hi> of a <hi>holy thing;</hi> or more fully, as I before ſaid; <hi>a viſible ſign of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Grace, inſtituted for our Juſtification.</hi>
                     </q> So that neither then <hi>Symbols</hi> alone, nor the <hi>inviſible part,</hi> or <hi>Grace alone,</hi> can with any manner of <hi>propriety</hi> be called a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> but the <hi>Sign</hi> referr'd to the <hi>Grace;</hi> and as it is the <hi>Symbol</hi> inſtituted by Chriſt for the <hi>conferring</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>This therefore can with no good reaſon be called a <hi>Catholick Aſſertion;</hi> being neither <hi>general</hi> nor <hi>true:</hi> But however, ſince he ſeems content to allow it to be an <hi>impropriety of Speech,</hi> and that, I confeſs, the
<note n="*" place="margin">Catec. Conc. Trid. part 2. de Euch. §. viii. nota p. 144.</note> 
                     <hi>Catechiſm</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> does lead him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; let us ſee what uſe he can make of it.
<note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 15. §. xi.</note> 
                     <q>And as Proteſtants much preſs, ſo <hi>Catholicks (Roman Catholicks)</hi> willingly acknowledg a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theſe two, The worſhipping of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as this word is taken for the <hi>Symbols;</hi> and the worſhipping of <hi>Chriſt's Body</hi> in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </q> There is, no doubt, a <hi>great difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>theſe two:</hi> but then they who tell us, the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> is to be <hi>Adored,</hi> if they will ſpeak <hi>rationally,</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:60616:74"/>muſt mean neither the <hi>one</hi> nor <hi>other</hi> of theſe, but the <hi>Hoſt;</hi> that is, as Card. <hi>Pallavicini</hi> expounds it, The <hi>whole,</hi> of which <hi>Chriſt's Body is a part;</hi> in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Council of Trent;</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> IN WHICH they believe <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be <hi>preſent,</hi> and for that <hi>Cauſe adore</hi> it; as the Cardinal again argues;
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>See above,</hi> pag. 91, 92.</note> that, <hi>To make a Whole Adorable, it is ſufficient that one part be ſo; and therefore ſince the Body of Chriſt is adorable, the Sacrament for its ſake is to be worſhipped.</hi> It is therefore a meer ſhift to tell us that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is to be <hi>adored; i. e. Chriſt's Body</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Nor will the remark of our Author help us out, that tho the <hi>Chapter</hi> indeed calls it the <hi>Sacrament</hi> IN WHICH <hi>is Chriſt's Body,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 16 §. xiii.</note> yet the <hi>Canon</hi> ſpeaks more <hi>preciſely,</hi> and calls it <hi>Chriſt in the Sacrament;</hi> unleſs he ſuppoſes the <hi>Council</hi> to have been <hi>infallible</hi> in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> only, and not in the <hi>Chapters;</hi> as ſome have thought, that they may be out in their <hi>Proofs,</hi> but cannot be in their <hi>Concluſions.</hi> But however, ſince he ſo much deſires it, for my part I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to allow them this too; for I ſhould be glad by any means to ſee them ſenſible of their Errors. But yet ſo as that it be eſteem'd only a <hi>private Opinion this,</hi> not a <hi>Catholick Aſſertion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly; <hi>Catholicks,</hi> he means the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſtill,
<note place="margin">P. 21. §. xvii.</note> 
                     <q>ground their <hi>Adoration,</hi> not upon <hi>Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> as if <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> defeated, <hi>Adoration</hi> is ſo too; but on a <hi>Real Preſence</hi> with the <hi>Symbols,</hi> which in general is agreed on by the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them.</q> By which Aſſertion, if he means only to make this Diſcovery, That Chriſt's <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> together with the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> is in his Opinion as good a ground for <hi>Adoration,</hi> as if he were there only with the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60616:75"/>
                     <hi>Species</hi> of the <hi>Bread,</hi> the <hi>Subſtance</hi> being changed into his <hi>Body;</hi> I have no more to ſay to it. But if he would hereby make us believe, that 'tis all one whether Chriſt be <hi>adored,</hi> as ſuppoſed here by the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> in this Holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and as imagined there by the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> I muſt then deny his <hi>Aſſertion;</hi> and deſire him to keep home to his own <hi>manner of Real Preſence,</hi> and which I ſhall preſently convince him, will leave them in a much worſe condition than their Neighbours, whom he would draw into the ſame Snare with them. And therefore, whereas he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly;
<note place="margin">P. 22. §. xviii.</note> 
                     <q>That ſuppoſing <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to be an <hi>Error,</hi> yet if the Tenent of <hi>Corporal</hi> or <hi>Real Preſence</hi> (as held by the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or others) be true; <hi>Catholicks</hi> (he would ſay <hi>Papiſts)</hi> plead their <hi>Adoration,</hi> is no way fruſtrated, but ſtill warrantable:</q> I muſt tell him, that the <hi>Adoration</hi> of thoſe among the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who worſhip Chriſt in this Sacrament upon the account of his <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> in, or with the <hi>Bread,</hi> tho it be an Error, yet is infinitely more excuſable than theirs, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Bread</hi> to be turned into Chriſt's <hi>Body;</hi> and becauſe it may not be thought that I ſpeak this out of any prejudice againſt them, I will here offer my Reaſons for it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt, They that <hi>adore Chriſt</hi> as <hi>really preſent,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Bread,</hi> do no violence to their <hi>Senſes:</hi> They confeſs, that what they <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>taſte,</hi> and <hi>feel,</hi> and <hi>ſmell,</hi> is <hi>really Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> Whilſt the <hi>Papiſt</hi> in denying the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to remain; or that what he <hi>ſees,</hi> and <hi>feels,</hi> and <hi>ſmells,</hi> and <hi>taſtes,</hi> is what all the World perceives and knows it is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts his <hi>Senſes,</hi> and in them the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:60616:75"/>that Means which God has given us to <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>lead</hi> us into the ſearch of <hi>Truth;</hi> and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence errs againſt infinitely greater Means of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> and ſo is more inexcuſable than the Other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly; They who worſhip Chriſt, as ſuppoſing Him to be together with the <hi>Bread</hi> in this <hi>Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> are erroneous indeed in this, that they take Chriſt's <hi>Body</hi> to be where really it is not; but yet their Object is undoubtedly right, and in that they are not miſtaken. But now for the <hi>Papiſt;</hi> he <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores,</hi> 'tis confeſs'd, what he thinks to be Chriſt's <hi>Body;</hi> and would not otherwiſe <hi>adore</hi> it: But yet ſtill 'tis the <hi>Hoſt</hi> that he <hi>adores,</hi> the Subſtance that is under thoſe <hi>Species</hi> which he ſees; and which if it be not Chriſt, but meer <hi>Subſtance</hi> of <hi>Bread,</hi> the Caſe is vaſtly alter'd between the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Him.</hi> The former <hi>adores Chriſt,</hi> only as in a place where he is not; the latter not only do's this, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>adores</hi> a <hi>Subſtance</hi> for Chriſt which is not his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> but a meer <hi>Creature</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>Daille</hi> therefore might rightly enough ſay of a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> 
                     <q>that his <hi>Adoration</hi> is miſtaken,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 23. §. xix.</note> not in this—that it addreſſeth it ſelf to an <hi>Object</hi> not <hi>adorable,</hi> but only that by Error it ſeeks and thinks to enjoy it in a place where it is not; and ſo becomes only <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>unprofitable:</hi>
                     </q> And yet our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has no manner of Reaſon from thence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that a <hi>Papiſt</hi> who terminates his <hi>Adoration</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Subſtance</hi> which <hi>really</hi> is not Chriſt's <hi>Body,</hi> but only miſtaken by him to be ſo, ſhall be in the ſame Condition: there being an apparently vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between worſhipping Chriſt in a place where he is not, and worſhipping that for Chriſt which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60616:76"/>really is not Chriſt, but only a created <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this in truth our Author ſeems to have been ſenſible of, and therefore thinks to evade it, by ſaying, <q>That they do not worſhip the <hi>Subſtance</hi> that is in that <hi>place,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ibid p. 23.</note> under ſuch <hi>Accidents</hi> whatever it be, (which if <hi>Bread</hi> ſhould happen to be there, he confeſſes would make them <hi>Bread-worſhippers</hi>) but they worſhip it only upon <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> that it is Chriſt's <hi>Body,</hi>
                     </q> and not <hi>Bread.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, be this ſo: But what now if they are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in their <hi>Suppoſition:</hi> They worſhip, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, the <hi>Subſtance</hi> that is under thoſe <hi>Accidents,</hi> ſuppoſing it to be Chriſt's <hi>Body;</hi> but ſtill, miſtaken or not, that <hi>Subſtance</hi> which is under thoſe Species, whatever it be, they do worſhip: And if they have, as he thinks, a <hi>rational ground</hi> for this <hi>Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which we ſhall ſee by and by, yet this will only excuſe them from being <hi>formal Idolaters;</hi> but will not hinder but that their Worſhip is ſtill directed to an <hi>undue Object,</hi> if that which is under the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> be indeed but <hi>Bread,</hi> and not Chriſt's <hi>Body</hi> as they imagine. And this then may ſerve to argue the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what he lays down as his</p>
                  <p>Fifth,
<note place="margin">P. 22. §. xix.</note> 
                     <hi>Catholick Aſſertion:</hi> 
                     <q>That ſuppoſing both the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> miſtaken in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet there can be no pretence why the One ſhould not be as excuſable as the others.</q> Since as I have ſaid; 1ſt, They err more groſly in abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conviction of their <hi>Senſes,</hi> which the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> do not; 2dly, They worſhip a <hi>Subſtance</hi> for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which really is not: To which if this be not enough, I will add yet two other Reaſons: 3dly, That they make the <hi>Conſecration,</hi> without
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60616:76"/>which Chriſt is not preſent upon their own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to depend on ſuch uncertainties (as I ſhall more fully ſhew anon) that they can never be ſure that Chriſt is there, which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are free from: And laſtly; They <hi>Anathematize</hi> thoſe who diſſent from them as to this <hi>Point,</hi> and ſo make a <hi>Schiſm</hi> in dividing the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church,</hi> which the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> are ſo far from doing, that they neither eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh any Doctrine of <hi>Adoration</hi> at all, nay many of them do not believe it; and upon occaſion, freely <hi>communicate</hi> with thoſe who diſſent from them in their belief, both of their way of the <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> and of the <hi>Adoration.</hi> And for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I cannot totally aſſent to his</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixth Aſſertion:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 25. §. xxi.</note> 
                     <q>That ſuppoſing there be no ſuch <hi>Real Preſence</hi> as either of them believes, yet that their <hi>adoration</hi> of Chriſt, who is a true <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Supreme Adoration,</hi> and only by them miſtaken to be in ſome <hi>place</hi> where He is not, cannot be termed any ſuch <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as is the <hi>worſhipping</hi> of an <hi>Object</hi> not at all <hi>adorable.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This as to what concerns thoſe of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> who adore Chriſt in the Sacrament, is true: But for the <hi>Papiſt</hi> it is not. He intends, I allow it, to worſhip Chriſt, but he miſtakes an <hi>Object</hi> for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is only a piece of <hi>Bread.</hi> He worſhips his <hi>Hoſt,</hi> ſuppoſing it to be our <hi>Saviour's Body,</hi> but his Error is groſs, and he not only miſtakes Chriſt to be in a place where he is not, but he miſtakes that to be Chriſt which indeed is not, but only a <hi>ſimple Wafer.</hi> His Worſhip therefore is not like the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> worſhipping of Chriſt in the <hi>Sun;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as if the <hi>Manichee</hi> ſhould, from ſome miſtaken grounds, have fancy'd the <hi>Sun</hi> it ſelf to be turned
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60616:77"/>into Chriſt's <hi>Body;</hi> and then in defiance of all <hi>Scripture, Senſe,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> ſhould have fallen down before it; but with a <hi>good Intention</hi> not to <hi>adore</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> but the <hi>Body</hi> of our Bleſſed Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> This is the true <hi>Parallel;</hi> only that herein ſtill the <hi>Manichee</hi> would have been the more excuſable of the two, by how much the <hi>Sun</hi> is a more likely Object to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for Chriſt's <hi>glorified Body</hi> than <hi>a Morſel of Bread;</hi> and leſs capable of being diſcovered by our <hi>Senſes</hi> and <hi>Examination</hi> not to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>It remains then, that theſe <hi>Lutherans</hi> only <hi>adore</hi> Chriſt where he is not; the <hi>Papiſts</hi> not only do this, but more-over they <hi>adore</hi> that for <hi>Chriſt</hi> which <hi>really is not,</hi> but a meer <hi>created Subſtance.</hi> Both the One and the Other are Erroneous; but the Papiſt's Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, renders him at the leaſt guilty of <hi>material I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,</hi> whereas the <hi>Lutherans</hi> is only an undue Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his Worſhip as to the <hi>Place,</hi> but right as to the <hi>Perſon.</hi> Let us ſee,</p>

                  <p>But before we proceed to theſe Points, we muſt yet have one touch more upon the old String:
<note place="margin">Pag. 26. §. xxiii.</note> 
                     <q>For the <hi>Lutherans, he ſays,</hi> being allow'd to have ſuch a plauſible <hi>Ground</hi> or Motive for their <hi>Adoration,</hi> whereby they become Abſolved by other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in <hi>adoring</hi> our Lord as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there, I ſee not why the <hi>Grounds</hi> of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> ſhould be any whit leſs valued than theirs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to which, the <hi>Reader</hi> may pleaſe to remember, that I have before ſaid, that we do not excuſe thoſe <hi>Lutherans</hi> who do this ſo much upon this Principle, that they have a more <hi>plauſible Ground</hi> or <hi>Motive</hi> for their <hi>Adoration;</hi> but for this rather, that confeſſing the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> to remain, they do not miſtake their <hi>Object,</hi> but pay their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration</hi> indeed to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> only ſuppoſing him to be there where in Truth he is not. But, 2dly, this Author is very much miſtaken if he thinks the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> have no better a Foundation for their <hi>Real Preſence</hi> than the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Ibid.</note> Indeed, were the difference no greater than between a <hi>Con</hi> and a <hi>Trans,</hi> it would, I confeſs, be hardly worth the while to contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. But when we come to the Point it ſelf, we may obſerve theſe four Advantages, among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſide. 1. They confeſs for the outward <hi>Elements,</hi> that they are <hi>really</hi> what they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be, <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine;</hi> and ſo they do no <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> to their <hi>Senſes;</hi> which, as I have ſaid, is a great <hi>aggravation</hi> againſt the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> 2. By this means they are at no defiance with all thoſe Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where they are ſo often called <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> after <hi>Conſecration:</hi> All which the <hi>Papiſt</hi> contradicts, but the <hi>Lutheran</hi> does not. 3. From the words of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60616:78"/>Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> we all of us confeſs may be inferr'd, that <hi>Chriſt's Body</hi> is in this Holy <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> But whence do's the <hi>Papiſt</hi> infer the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Bread;</hi> ſo that what is <hi>taken,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>given,</hi> is not <hi>Bread,</hi> but Chriſt's <hi>Body</hi> under the appearance of <hi>Bread?</hi> This is an Error which I am ſure the Text gives no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of colour to; and therefore our Author cannot with any reaſon pretend, as he do's, whether we conſult the Text of Holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> or our own <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> that they have as good <hi>grounds</hi> for their <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> have for theirs. To all which let me add, 4thly, that by <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> they deſtroy the very Nature of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> by leaving no true external <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Symbol,</hi> and which is another unanſwerable Argument againſt them, whilſt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> acknowledging the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> to remain, do not deſtroy at all the Nature of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but retain the ſame <hi>Sign</hi> which our Bleſſed Lord eſtabliſhed, and ſo have no Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on this ſide neither to convict them.</p>
                  <p>But yet notwithſtanding all this,
<note place="margin">Pag. 26, 27.</note> 
                     <q>Do not ſome of our Writers confeſs, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is more rational than the <hi>Lutherans?</hi>
                     </q> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; What certain <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may have ſaid in Zeal for their own Opinions, and in particular <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpinian</hi> upon the account of his Maſter <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> I cannot tell: But ſure I am, we are not bound to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for all that any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Author has ſaid. And if theſe Reaſons I have here given for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary are valid, they ought to be more regarded, than the ungrounded Aſſertions of a <hi>Sacramentary</hi> Hiſtorian.</p>

                  <p>Well,
<note place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> but ſtill the <q>
                        <hi>Papiſt</hi> do's not ground his <hi>Adoration</hi> upon <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> but on <hi>Corporal Preſence;</hi> and ſo they muſt <hi>both</hi> be excuſed, or neither.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a fetch to very little purpoſe: For let me ask this Author; He confeſſes he founds his <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon the <hi>Corporal Preſence:</hi> Do's he believe the <hi>Corporal Preſence</hi> in the way of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> excluſive to all others, or no? If he do's, then 'tis evident that the <hi>Corporal Preſence</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> muſt with him ſtand or fall together; and ſo if he <hi>adores</hi> on the account of the <hi>Corporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> he do's it upon the account of <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> If he do's not believe this, 'tis plain he is no <hi>Papist,</hi> nor ſubmits to the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which has defined the <hi>Corporal Preſence</hi> to be after this particular manner, excluſive to all Others, and <hi>Anathematized</hi> all that dare to deny it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">P. 28. §. xxv.</note> Their ſecond Ground is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Authority</hi> of thoſe <hi>Councils</hi> that have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined this Matter; <q>The Declaration, <hi>as he calls it,</hi> of the moſt <hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are great Words indeed; but I wonder who ever heard before that a few miſerable
<note n="*" place="margin">Theſe are his Synods; at <hi>Rome, Vercelles, Tours; Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>An.</hi> 1059. and again, <hi>An.</hi> 1078.</note> 
                     <hi>Synods</hi> of particular Prelats, ſuch as are all thoſe to which he refers us, aſſembled againſt <hi>Berengarius,</hi> were <hi>the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60616:80"/>moſt ſupream and univerſal Church-Authority.</hi> For his little Reflection, that they were aſſembled long before the birth of <hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi> I muſt tell him, I doubt he is miſtaken. The Religion of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> like that of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> is compoſs'd of two great parts; <hi>Catholick Chriſtianity,</hi> common in ſome meaſure to us all; and <hi>Proteſtations againſt Popery.</hi> Now 'tis true, for what concerns the latter of theſe, we allow <hi>Popery</hi> to have the advantage of us, as to the Point of <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> nor are we aſhamed to own it: It being neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that they ſhould have fallen into <hi>Errors,</hi> before we could <hi>proteſt</hi> againſt <hi>them;</hi> but as to the preſent matter, our Author in his

                     <hi>Guide,</hi> to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us, confeſſes that <hi>Berengarius,</hi> againſt whom theſe little <hi>Synods</hi> were called, proceeded upon <hi>Proteſtant Grounds, i. e.</hi> in effect was a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> as to this Point: And therefore 'tis falſe in him now to ſay, that theſe Councils were <hi>aſſembled long before the birth of Proteſtantiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I return to his Church Authority; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; 1. If this Doctrine be certainly contrary to <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as was before ſaid, then he has told us before, that <q>
                        <hi>no Motive whatever, no Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho never ſo plain, can be ſufficient to engage us to believe it.</hi>
                     </q> 2. For his <hi>Councils,</hi> the eldeſt of them was above a thouſand Years after Chriſt, when by our own Confeſſion, the Error, tho not of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> yet of the <hi>Corporal Preſence,</hi> was creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Church. 3. Theſe <hi>Councils</hi> were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a <hi>Party</hi> againſt <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and therefore no wonder if they condemned him. 4. They were neither <hi>univerſal</hi> of the whole Church, or even of the <hi>Weſtern Patriachate</hi> in which they aſſembled; and therefore we can have no ſecurity that they did not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60616:80"/>err, tho we ſhould grant this Priviledg to a truly <hi>General Council</hi> that it could not. 5. 'Tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that ſome of them did err; foraſmuch as the very

I have before ſhewn, that were this a <hi>rational Ground,</hi> yet it fails them too; for neither do the <hi>Genuine Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> nor any other that I know of, either believe Chriſt's <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body</hi> to be ſubſtantially preſent in the Holy <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> or to be <hi>adored</hi> there: I am ſure if there be any ſuch, they cannot be the <hi>Genuine Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in this Matter, who believe ſo expreſly contrary to her formal Declaration, as this Author has himſelf obſerved.</p>
                  <p>And then for the <hi>Lutherans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. Pag. 32.</note> to whom he again returns; it is hard to conceive what <hi>rational ground</hi> of Security they can derive from their practice; that becauſe they commit no <hi>Idolatry</hi> in worſhipping what they know certainly to be Chriſt, the <hi>Papist</hi> commits none for worſhipping what he do's not know certainly is Chriſt; in truth what, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he might know certainly is not Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And now after a ſerious and impartial Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Grounds produced in Vindication of this <hi>Worſhip;</hi> tho I could have wiſh'd I might have found them as <hi>rational</hi> as our Author pretends them to be, and ſhall be glad, as they are, that they may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after prove ſufficient to excuſe them from the Guilt of <hi>formal Idolatry</hi> in this <hi>Adoration;</hi> yet I muſt needs ſay, I do in my Conſcience think 'tis more <q>an exceſs of <hi>Charity,</hi>

                     </q> And the Teſtimonies he produces, argue rather the candor of our Affections towards them, even ſuch
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60616:83"/>as to hope, almoſt againſt Hope for their ſakes; than give any ſecurity to them in their Errors. And becauſe I would willingly, if poſſible, convince them of it, I will very briefly ſubjoin a Reaſon or two.</p>
                  <q>2dly; Why even upon their own <hi>Principles</hi> I am not ſatisfied that they have ſuch a <hi>rational Ground</hi> for this <hi>Adoration,</hi> as may be ſufficient to excuſe them.</q>
                  <p>For, 1ſt, It is granted by this Author,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 26. §. xxii.</note> 
                     <q>That a meerly <hi>good Intention</hi> grounded upon a <hi>culpable Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> cannot excuſe them from <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                     </q> So that if their <hi>ignorance</hi> then be really <hi>culpable,</hi> their <hi>good Intention</hi> will not be ſufficient to excuſe them. Now the <hi>ignorance</hi> upon which this practice is founded, is their miſtaken interpretation of thoſe words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and whether that be a <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> or <hi>culpable</hi> Miſtake, we ſhall beſt be able to judg by two or three Obſervations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is confeſs'd by the greateſt Men of their Church, that there is <hi>no neceſſity</hi> to interpret thoſe words in that manner that they do; ſo that had not the Authority of their Church interpoſed, they might have been <hi>equally verified</hi> in our Interpretation. And this muſt be allow'd, unleſs we ſhall ſay, that all places of Holy Scripture muſt be underſtood in a <hi>literal ſenſe,</hi> whatever the Conſequence be of ſo doing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Author himſelf confeſſes, that if the taking of them in the <hi>literal ſenſe</hi> do's involve a <hi>certain Contradiction,</hi> then it cannot be right; but we are <hi>bound</hi> to ſeek out ſome other Expoſition to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void a <hi>certain Contradiction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:60616:84"/>3. It is undeniable, that their Interpretation of theſe words deſtroys the certainty of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and in that of the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> which was confirmed by <hi>Miracles,</hi> known only by the <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of <hi>Senſe;</hi> and by Conſequence of this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Point, that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is revealed to us by God, or can be rely'd upon as coming from him.</p>
                  <p>Now from theſe Principles I thus argue: If that <hi>ſenſe</hi> of theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> upon which they ground their <hi>Adoration,</hi> do's neceſſarily imply many plain and certain <hi>Contradictions,</hi> then by their own Confeſſion that cannot be the right <hi>ſenſe</hi> of them. But that it do's ſo, and that without groſs and culpable <hi>Ignorance</hi> they cannot doubt of but know it, I thus ſhew. He that believes theſe words in the ſenſe of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> muſt believe the ſame <hi>natural Body,</hi> at the ſame time, to be in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thouſand ſeveral places upon Earth, and yet ſtill to be but <hi>one Body,</hi> and that all the while in Heaven: He muſt believe that the ſame <hi>natural Body</hi> is at the ſame time <hi>extended</hi> in all its Parts, and yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing ſtill the <hi>ſame Body</hi> without any change, to be <hi>unextended,</hi> and have no diſtinct Parts, nor be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being divided into any: He muſt believe the ſame <hi>Body</hi> at the ſame time, to move, and to lie ſtill: to be the Object of our Senſes, and yet not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible by any: With infinite others of the like kind
<note n="*" place="margin">See above, Ch. 2. of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</hi> Pag. 32, 33.</note> as I have more fully ſhewn before. But now all theſe are groſs <hi>Contradictions,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of a <hi>Body,</hi> and to the common <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> in all Mankind; and no Man can, without <hi>culpable Ignorance</hi> pretend not to know them to be ſo: And therefore, notwithſtanding any ſuch ſuppoſed <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> as may be pretended from thoſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60616:84"/>words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> they cannot, by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's own <hi>Rule,</hi> without <hi>culpable Ignorance,</hi> not know that they are miſtaken in this Matter.</p>
                  <p>Again: No <hi>Papiſt</hi> can have any reaſon to believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to be true, but becauſe he reads thoſe words of Holy Scripture, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> That theſe words are in Scripture, he can know on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his <hi>Senſes:</hi> If his <hi>Senſes</hi> therefore are not to be truſted, he is not ſure there are any ſuch words in Scripture. If they are to be truſted, he is then ſure that the <hi>Interpretation</hi> which he puts upon them muſt be <hi>falſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since then it is confeſs'd, that there is <hi>no neceſſity</hi> to underſtand thoſe words in a <hi>literal ſenſe;</hi> and that both upon the account of the <hi>Contradictions</hi> that ſuch an Expoſition involves to the <hi>common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reaſon,</hi> and to the certain <hi>Evidence of the Senſes of all Mankind,</hi> it is neceſſary to take them in ſome other meaning, it remains that without groſs and <hi>culpable Ignorance</hi> they cannot pretend not to know, that this could never have been the intention of our Bleſſed Saviour in thoſe <hi>words;</hi> and that ſuch <hi>Ignorance</hi> will not <hi>excuſe</hi> them, our Author himſelf has freely confeſs'd.</p>
                  <p>But, 2dly, let us quit this Reflection, and for once ſuppoſe the poſſibility of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> Yet ſtill it is confeſs'd by them: 1. That there is no Command nor Example in holy Scripture for <hi>adoring</hi> Chriſt in the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> 2. That infinite Defects may happen to hinder him from being there; and then what they <hi>worſhip</hi> is only a piece of <hi>Bread.</hi> 3. That they can never be ſure that ſome of theſe <hi>Defects</hi> have not happened; and by conſequence, that what they ſuppoſe to be <hi>Christ's Body,</hi> is indeed any more than a <hi>meer Wafer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:60616:85"/>
                  <p>From whence I argue;</p>
                  <p>He that without any Command or Warrant of God, pays a <hi>Divine Adoration</hi> to that which he can never be ſure is more than a <hi>meer Creature,</hi> can never be ſure that he do's not commit <hi>Idolatry:</hi> But whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever worſhips the <hi>Host,</hi> worſhips that which he can never be ſure is more than a <hi>meer Creature;</hi> and therefore he can never be ſure that in ſo doing he do's not commit <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now concerning the former of theſe, how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous it is for any one to give <hi>Divine Worſhip</hi> to what he can never be ſure is any more than a <hi>meer Creature,</hi> be it conſidered, what <hi>jealouſy</hi> God has at all times expreſs'd of his <hi>Honour</hi> as to this Matter; how ſtrict he has been in the peculiar vindication of his Supreme <hi>Prerogative</hi> in ſuch Caſes. How there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that will come to him, muſt be very well aſſured that it is God to whom he approaches; and therefore if he has but the leaſt reaſon to <hi>doubt</hi> of it, ought not to worſhip with a <hi>doubting Mind;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ought not to do that the <hi>omitting</hi> whereof can be no <hi>fault,</hi> but the <hi>doing</hi> of which may, for ought he knows, be a very great <hi>Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the ſecond; Whether every <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> who <hi>adores</hi> the <hi>Host,</hi> has not even upon his own <hi>Principles,</hi> very great cauſe to doubt, whether he <hi>adores</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Body,</hi> or only a bit of <hi>Bread,</hi> will appear from thoſe infinite Defects which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves allow as ſufficient to hinder a <hi>Conſecration;</hi> and which make it great odds, were their Doctrine otherwiſe never ſo true, whether yet one <hi>Host</hi> in twenty, it may be in five hundred, be conſecrated.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. With reference to the Holy <hi>Elements</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated: If the <hi>Bread</hi> be not all, or at leaſt the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p n="2">2.

                     <q>The Council of <hi>Conſtance, ſays he,</hi> excuſes thoſe who in their ſimplicity <hi>adore</hi> an <hi>unconſecrated Host,</hi> becauſe this condition is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60616:86"/>implied, <hi>if it be rightly conſecrated:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he adviſes, let them ſo adore the Hoſt, <hi>I ADORE THEE IF THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> ART CHRIST.</hi>
                     </q> But now if, as the Apoſtle tells us in another caſe, <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith, is Sin;</hi> and, <hi>He that doubts, is damned if he eats:</hi> I ſhall leave it to any ſober Chriſtian to ſay what ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity there can be in ſuch a <hi>Worſhip,</hi> which is neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, encouraged, or commanded in Holy Scripture; and which they themſelves confeſs they can never be certain is addreſſed to a right <hi>Object;</hi> and therefore are forced to ſuch Shifts and Reſerves, as were they once admitted, might make any other Creature in the World as warrantably <hi>adorable</hi> as their <hi>Hoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How much better were it for them to <hi>adore</hi> their Bleſſed Saviour in <hi>Heaven,</hi> where his <hi>glorified Body</hi> moſt certainly is: Where there can therefore be no danger to <hi>lift up our Hearts</hi> unto him. Were his Sacred <hi>Body</hi> indeed <hi>ſubſtantially preſent</hi> in this Bleſſed <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet ſtill it would be in a manner to us impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, in the ſtate of his Death, and by conſequence of his Humiliation; and we might therefore have ſome cauſe to doubt whether, ſince we have received no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand concerning it, it were our Saviour's Pleaſure that his <hi>Body</hi> ſhould be <hi>adored</hi> by us in that State: So that there could be no Sin in the not doing of it. But now amidſt ſo many Doubts, not only upon Ours, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon their own Principles, that they dare not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>worſhip at a venture,</hi> that which yet they do <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi> tho I ſhall leave them to their own Maſter to ſtand or fall at the Great Day, yet I muſt needs profeſs I think there is very much hazard in it. A great Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and great Ignorance, may excuſe a poor untaught, and therefore <hi>blindly obedient</hi> Multitude: but for their <hi>Guides,</hi> who lead them into Error, for thoſe to whom
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60616:87"/>God has given Capacities and Opportunities (as to thoſe now among us he has done, of being better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) I can only ſay, <hi>Lord, lay not this Sin to their Charge!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this may ſuffice to have been ſaid to the third Thing propoſed, of their <hi>Rational Grounds</hi> for this Worſhip.
<note place="margin">Pag. 37. §. xxxiii.</note> For what our Author finally adds; <q>That to adore that which the Adorer believes not to be our Lord, but Bread, would be unlawful to be done by any, ſo long as the Perſon continues ſo perſwaded—But then if we ſuppoſe the Church <hi>juſtly</hi> requiring ſuch Adoration upon ſuch a true Preſence of our Lord, neither will the ſame Perſon be free from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning greatly in his following ſuch his Conſcience, and in his not adoring.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer: It will then be time enough to conſider this, when either the <hi>Church</hi> to which we owe an <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> ſhall require it of us, or they be able to prove that in ſuch a Caſe the <hi>Church</hi> would not <hi>ſin</hi> in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding,</hi> and not <hi>we</hi> in <hi>refuſing</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> her. But, bleſſed be God, there is no great danger of either of theſe: Our <hi>Church</hi> is too well perſwaded of the unlawfulneſs of ſuch a <hi>Worſhip,</hi> ever to require it of us. And for that <hi>Church</hi> which has ſo uncharitably undertaken to <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematize</hi> all thoſe who will not own her <hi>Authority,</hi> and receive her Errors, tho never ſo groſs, as Articles of Faith: We are ſo fully convinced of the unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of her Pretences, and of our own Liberty, that we ſhall hardly be brought to ſubmit our ſelves to the Conduct of ſuch a <hi>blind Guide,</hi> leſt we ſall into the ſame <hi>Ditch,</hi> into which ſhe her ſelf is tumbled. And it would certainly much better become our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and his Brethren, to conſider how they can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify their <hi>Diſobedience</hi> to their own <hi>Mother,</hi> than to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60616:87"/>endeavour at this rate to lead us into the ſame <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> both to our <hi>Religion</hi> and our <hi>Church</hi> with them.</p>

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>AND thus by the Bleſſing of God, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a good Cauſe, have I very briefly paſſed through this Author's <hi>Reflections,</hi> and I am perſwaded ſufficiently ſhewn the weakneſs and falſity of the moſt of them. If any one ſhall think that I ought to have inſiſted more largely upon ſome Points, he may pleaſe to know, that ſince by the importunate Provocations of thoſe of the <hi>other Communion,</hi> we have been forced too often to interrupt thoſe Duties of our <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> in which we could rather have wiſh'd to have employ'd our Time, for theſe kind of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies which ſerve ſo very little to any purpoſes, either of true Piety, or true Charity among us: We have reſolved thus far at leaſt to gratify both our ſelves and others, as to make our <hi>Diſputes</hi> as <hi>ſhort</hi> as is poſſible; and looſe no more time in them, than the neceſſary Defence of our ſelves and the Truth do require.</p>
               <p>I have indeed paſs'd by much of our Author's <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,</hi> becauſe they are almoſt intirely made up of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and endleſs <hi>Repetitions</hi> of the ſame things, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often in the ſame words. But for any thing that is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative, or otherwiſe material to the main <hi>Cauſe,</hi> I do not know that I have either let the Obſervation of it ſlip, or diſſembled at all the Force of it.</p>
               <p>It was once in my thoughts to have made ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections in the Cloſe upon the <hi>Changes</hi> of their <hi>Ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi> in requital for our Author's Obſervations on the <hi>Alterations</hi> of our <hi>Liturgie;</hi> but I have inſiſted longer
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60616:88"/>than I deſigned already, and ſhall therefore content my my ſelf to have given the Hint of what might have been done, and ſhall ſtill be done, if our Author, or any in his behalf deſire it of me.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I cannot but obſerve the unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of that <hi>Method</hi> which is here taken; from the Expreſſions of ſome of our Divines, and the Conceſſions of others, whoſe profeſs'd Buſineſs it was to reconcile, if poſſible, all Parties, and therefore were forced ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to condeſcend more than was fit for the doing it; and even theſe too miſerably <hi>mangled</hi> and <hi>miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> to pretend to prove the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> contrary to the <hi>expreſs Declarations</hi> of the <hi>Publick Acts</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> of it. This has been the endeavour of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of our late Writers, but of this <hi>Diſcourſer</hi> above any. Had thoſe worthy Perſons, whoſe Memory they thus abuſe, been yet living, they might have had an ample Confutation from their own Pens; as, in the very Inſtance before us, has been given them for the like ill uſe made by ſome among them, of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Meditations</hi> of a moſt Excellent and Learned <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of our <hi>Church;</hi> and who might otherwiſe in the next Age have been improved into a new Witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. I do not think that Bp <hi>Taylour</hi> ever thought he ſhould have been ſet up as a favourer of <hi>Popery,</hi> who had written ſo expreſly and warmly againſt it. Yet I cannot but obſerve a kind of Prophetick Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in his Book of the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> which being ſo often quoted by theſe Men, I ſomewhat wonder it ſhould have ſlipp'd their Remark: Where ſpeaking of their Shifts to make any One they pleaſe of their ſide,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> §. xii. n. 28. pag. 261.</note> he has theſe words; <q>And—I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>ſays he,</hi> but it may be poſſible, but a WITTY MAN may pretend, when I am dead, that in this
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60616:88"/>
                     <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> I have pleaded for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We have now lived to ſee ſome of thoſe WITTY MEN that have done but little leſs than this; tho how <hi>Honeſt</hi> they are in the mean time, I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. But I hope this Deſign too ſhall be from henceforth in good meaſure fruſtrated: And therefore, ſince neither their <hi>New Religion,</hi> nor their <hi>New Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates</hi> will do their Buſineſs; ſince it is in vain that they either <hi>miſrepreſent</hi> their own <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or our <hi>Authors</hi> in favour of it; may they once pleaſe either honeſtly to avow and defend their Faith, or honeſtly to confeſs that they cannot do it. Such ſhuffling as this, do's but more convince us of the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of their <hi>Cauſe;</hi> and inſtead of defending their <hi>Religion</hi> by theſe Practices, they only encreaſe in us our <hi>ill Opinion</hi> of that, and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen that <hi>good One</hi> which we willingly would, but ſhall not always be able to conſerve of <hi>thoſe,</hi> who by ſuch indirect means as theſe, endeavour to ſupport it.</p>
